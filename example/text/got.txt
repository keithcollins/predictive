ARYA: What are they doing with the bodies?
WAIF: Get back to work.
ARYA: No! I’ve been here for weeks. I’m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I’m doing it.
WAIF: You will know why.
ARYA: When?
WAIF: When it’s time. Not before. Get back to work.
ARYA: When do I get to play the game?
WAIF: Game?
ARYA: The game. The game of faces.
WAIF: You tried already. You failed.
ARYA: I didn’t even know I was playing.
WAIF: Who are you?
ARYA: No one.
WAIF: Get back to work.
ARYA: Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here?
WAIF: I’m from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn’t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I’ve been serving them ever since.
beat
WAIF: Was that true or a lie?
ARYA: What?
WAIF: Did you believe every word I said?
Arya is unsure.
WAIF: Get back to work.
INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - CHAMBERS - NIGHT
Arya is asleep.
JAQEN: Who are you?
Arya wakes up and turns to him.
JAQEN: Who are you?
ARYA: Arya.
JAQEN: And where did you come from?
ARYA: Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
Jaqen hits Arya with a stick.
JAQEN: A lie.
ARYA: After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
Jaqen hits her again.
JAQEN: A lie.
ARYA: I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
Jaqen hits her.
JAQEN: A lie.
ARYA: A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him.
Jaqen hits her.
ARYA: I hated him.
Jaqen hits her.
ARYA: I hated him!
Jaqen hits her again.
ARYA: That’s not a lie!
JAQEN: The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?
ARYA: Yes.
Jaqen hits her. Arya starts bleeding from the mouth.
ARYA: I’m not playing this stupid game anymore!
JAQEN: We never stop playing.
Jaqen exits the room.
EXT. SHORE
Jorah inspects the Grey Scale then covers it up.
TYRION: So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can’t live on berries and roots.
JORAH: I can.
TYRION: You’re not hungry?
JORAH: Of course I’m hungry.
TYRION: You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.
JORAH: I am not your travelling companion.
TYRION: We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…
JORAH: Do you ever shut up?
TYRION: I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
Jorah sits down next to Tyrion.
JORAH: Why?
TYRION: Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
JORAH: I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities.
TYRION: I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
Jorah gets up.
TYRION: As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.
JORAH: What do you know about my father?
TYRION: I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”
Jorah looks stunned.
TYRION: You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.
JORAH: How?
TYRION: I only know what I heard
JORAH (STRONGER): How?
TYRION: He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
JORAH: We better keep moving.
He gets up and walks away, then Tyrion.
INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
Arya is scrubbing the floor. A man carries a young girl in and sets her by the pool. He walks over to Arya and she stops scrubbing.
MAN: Valar morghulis.
ARYA: Valar dohaeris.
MAN: I have nowhere else to go. I’ve taken her to every healer in Braavos. I’ve spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.
Arya looks the man in the eyes then walks over to the girl.
GIRL: It hurts.
ARYA: I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.
Arya fills a cup with the water.
ARYA: I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink.
The girl takes a sip. Jaqen watches from afar.
INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - BODY ROOM
Arya fixes the dead girl’s hair. Jaqen walks in from the door Arya was trying to open earlier and leads her in. Arya follows him down a staircase lit by fire.
INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - HALL OF FACES
Arya looks up and sees the room is filled with columns containing the faces of the dead. She walks through the room, examining the faces.
JAQEN: Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?
Arya scans through the faces then fixates on one face in particular - that of an old lady.
JAQEN: No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE
TYRION: Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion.
JORAH: Do you believe in anything?
TYRION: I believe in many things.
JORAH: In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?
TYRION: No.
JORAH: Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?
TYRION: No.
JORAH: It's hard to be a cynic after that.
TYRION: Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.
JORAH: No it doesn’t.
TYRION: The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?
JORAH: First we have to conquer the world.
TYRION: We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?
JORAH: Then she rules.
TYRION: So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
JORAH: She is the rightful heir.
TYRION: Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?
Jorah sees a ship anchored in the middle of the sea and pushes Tyrion behind a rock.
JORAH: Shh! It’s a slave ship
TYRION: Why is it anchored?
JORAH: They probably came ashore for--
MALKO: --water.
Malko and his men, all carrying swords, surround Tyrion and Jorah, smiling.
SAME PLACE - LATER
Tyrion and Jorah’s hands are tied. Malko punches Jorah in the face. He gets up.
MALKO: Got a lot of fight in you, huh?
Malko punches Jorah again.
SLAVER: Salt mines.
MALKO: That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
SLAVER: What about the dwarf?
MALKO: Worthless. Cut his throat.
The slaver’s man approaches Tyrion.
TYRION: Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this!
MALKO: And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf’s cock has magic powers.
The slaver puts his sword to Tyrion’s throat.
TYRION: Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?
SLAVER: It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
TYRION: Guess again.
Tyrion looks to Malko.
MALKO: The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
The slavers get Jorah and Tyrion to their feet.
JORAH: Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
MALKO: We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.
TYRION: The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.
Malko looks at Tyrion and laughs.
TYRION: (looks at Jorah) Him.
MALKO: Him? He’s got to be 60 years old.
TYRION: Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!
Malko gestures to his men to bring Jorah closer.
MALKO: Is that true?
Jorah nods.
TYRION: He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.
Malko shakes his head and laughs.
TYRION: The Kingslayer!
MALKO: Jousting. You’re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
JORAH: I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
Malko jumps up, shocked, and gets in Jorah’s face.
MALKO: Liar.
JORAH: It’s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth.
Malko looks in his eyes, smiles, then nods.
EXT. KING’S LANDING - STREETS
Littlefinger walks by the Faith Militant.
LANCEL: Lord Baelish.
BAELISH: Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister.
LANCEL: Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
BAELISH: That’s quite a family to abandon.
LANCEL: The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run.
BAELISH: Well done.
He tries to walk past Lancel. Lancel puts his hand on Baelish’s shoulder and stops him.
BAELISH: I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I’ll be delayed?
Lancel lets go.
LANCEL: Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing.
BAELISH: We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.
INT. CERSEI’S ROOM
BAELISH: Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?
CERSEI: The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
BAELISH: Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
CERSEI: The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?
BAELISH: House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults.
CERSEI: House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.
BAELISH: One’s choice of companion is a curious thing.
Cersei is silent for a moment.
CERSEI: Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.
BAELISH: Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
CERSEI: She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.
BAELISH: I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
CERSEI: If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
BAELISH: Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
CERSEI: Good. (Cersei gets up) If there’s nothing else.
BAELISH: There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.
CERSEI: That’s not possible.
BAELISH: My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.
CERSEI: Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
BAELISH: Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
CERSEI: We were fools to trust a turncloak.
BAELISH: Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
CERSEI: I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
BAELISH: I would counsel patience, your grace.
CERSEI: Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.
BAELISH: Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.
CERSEI: Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.
BAELISH: That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.
CERSEI: My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
BAELISH: Ser Jaime, then.
CERSEI: Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.
BAELISH: Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.
CERSEI: Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.
BAELISH: You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?
CERSEI: And if you succeed?
BAELISH: Name me Warden of the North.
CERSEI: I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
BAELISH: I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
CERSEI: And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.
BAELISH: As I said. I live to serve.
EXT. DORNE - GARDEN
Trystane puts a flower in Myrcella’s hair.
TRYSTANE: I’m going to ask him tomorrow.
MYRCELLA: What if he says no?
TRYSTANE: He won’t. You’ve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
MYRCELLA: Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…
Trystane kisses her in the middle of the sentence. Myrcella pushes him off.
MYRCELLA: We can’t. Not yet.
TRYSTANE: Why not?
MYRCELLA: You know why not. Someone will see.
TRYSTANE: You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
MYRCELLA: How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
TRYSTANE: I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous.
MYRCELLA: They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question.
Cut to Doran and Areo on the balcony.
DORAN: They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
AREO: Yes, my prince.
DORAN: You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
AREO: I remember how.
EXT. DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE
BRONN (SINGING): The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
JAIME: Alright, thats enough.
BRONN: I’m coming to the best part.
JAIME: We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
BRONN: This song really is all about the ending.
JAIME: It can wait. Up there.
He spots a line of Dornishmen walking towards the Water Gardens.
JAIME: That’s the Water Gardens.
BRONN: Once we got the princess, then what?
JAIME: I like to improvise.
BRONN: That explains the golden hand.
EXT. DORNE - WATER GARDENS
Jaime and Bronn ride in behind common folk carrying meat and other goods. They break off from the pack.
INT. SHADOWY ROOM
ELLARIA: Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn.
SAND SNAKES: For Oberyn.
They storm towards the Water Gardens as Ellaria watches.
EXT. WATER GARDENS
Jamie and Bronn converge on Myrcella and Trystane as the Sand Snakes approach. They see the two kissing.
BRONN: Well, she’s made herself at home.
They walk over.
JAIME: Myrcella.
They stop kissing.
MYRCELLA: Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?
JAIME: Let’s speak in private.
TRYSTANE: I am Trystane Martell.
MYRCELLA: Trystane is my intended.
JAIME: Excellent. Good to meet you.
Jaime shakes hands with Trystane with his good hand.
TRYSTANE: We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime.
Bronn advances.
BRONN: Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?
Trystane inspects Bronn’s armor, looking for a sigil.
BRONN: Let’s not do something stupid.
Trystane reaches for his sword and Bronn punches him across the face, knocking him out.
MYRCELLA: No!
BRONN: That was something stupid.
JAIME: We have to go, Myrcella, now.
MYRCELLA: You hurt him!
JAIME: You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to--
A whip wraps around Jaime’s wrist. The Sand Snakes are here.
BRONN: Oh for fuck’s sake.
The Sand Snakes attack Jaime and Bronn, one wielding a spear, one wielding a whip, and one wielding a pair of daggers. They occupy Bronn and Jaime long enough for Obara to get to Myrcella.
OBARA: You’re coming with me.
MYRCELLA: I don’t want to!
OBARA: I wasn’t asking, princess.
Obara starts taking Myrcella out of the gardens. A Sand Snake cuts Bronn’s arm open. Areo and his men meet Obara as she escapes.
AREO: Drop you weapons!
The rest of Areo’s men surround the Sand Snakes, Bronn, and Jaime.
OBARA: I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
AREO: Drop your weapons!
The Snakes drop their weapons. Jaime stares down Areo, sword still in hand. Areo puts his axe to Jaime’s neck.
AREO: When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.
Jaime drops the sword, Areo’s men grab him. Bronn drops his sword.
BRONN (TO SNAKE): You fight pretty good for a little girl.
She screams at Bronn and is restrained by Areo’s men. They are all escorted away. The rest of Areo’s men corner Elaria in the room outside the Gardens.
EXT. THE KINGSROAD
A carriage rides on the outskirts of King’s Landing.
RIDER: Halt!
Cut to inside the carriage.
OLENNA: Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on.
EXT. KING’S LANDING - GARDEN
OLENNA: Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.
MARGAERY: Everyone knew about him and Renly.
OLENNA: Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
MARGAERY: But he was the king’s brother.
OLENNA: And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.
MARGAERY: Cersei is behind this.
OLENNA: Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.
INT. CERSEI’S ROOM
Cersei writes at her desk without acknowledging Olenna.
OLENNA: Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.
CERSEI: You must be exhausted.
OLENNA: Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything.
CERSEI: Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.
OLENNA: And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
CERSEI: Beg your pardon.
OLENNA: I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
CERSEI: If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
OLENNA: You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.
CERSEI: I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
OLENNA: Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?
CERSEI: I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
OLENNA: Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
CERSEI: As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--
OLENNA: What veil?
CERSEI: The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
OLENNA: I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
CERSEI: House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.
INT. HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM
HIGH SPARROW: You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
LORAS: I don’t pay attention to rumors.
SPARROW: You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in
LORAS: He was my friend. He was my king.
SPARROW: Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.
LORAS: I was wrong to support Renly’s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
SPARROW: Wearing Renly’s armor.
LORAS: Why does it matter what I wore?
SPARROW: Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy.
LORAS: Of course I deny them.
SPARROW: You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
LORAS: Never.
SPARROW: Nor any other man.
LORAS: Never.
SPARROW: That will be all Ser Loras.
Loras walks back to his seat.
OLENNA: Well I think that’s quite enough of that.
SPARROW: Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
MARGAERY: You call me forward?
SPARROW: Yes. We have some questions for you.
MARGAERY: I am the queen.
SPARROW: You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.
Margaery walks to the stand.
SPARROW: How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
MARGAERY: They are lies.
SPARROW: All of them?
MARGAERY: All of them.
SPARROW: Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?
MARGAERY: Yes, I swear it.
SPARROW: Thank you, your grace.
The Faith brings Olyvar in. Loras looks shocked. Cersei gives a thin smile.
SPARROW: Do you know this man?
OLYVAR: Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.
SPARROW: How did you come to meet?
OLYVAR: I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
SPARROW: And what occurred in his chamber?
OLYVAR: We engaged in intimate relations.
SPARROW: You laid with him?
OLYVAR: That night and many others.
LORAS: Liar! He’s a liar!
SPARROW: Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
OLYVAR: Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn’t seem surprised.
CERSEI: This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
OLYVAR: He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne.
Loras jumps at Olyvar and The Faith restrains him. Margaery and Olenna get up to leave and The Faith blocks their way.
LORAS: Liar!
OLENNA: What are you doing? Let us pass.
SPARROW: The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
MARGAERY: What?
SPARROW: Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
The Faith grabs her and carries her out of the room.
MARGAERY: Tommen! Tommen!
King Tommen looks around the room, unsure of what to do.
MARGAERY: You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!
Olenna glares at Cersei. Cersei smiles back.
INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER
Sansa looks at herself in the mirror. She hears a knock and opens the door. It's Myranda.
SANSA: What do you want?
MYRANDA: Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don’t you?
Cut to Sansa in the bath. Myranda washes the black dye out of Sansa’s hair.
MYRANDA: You’re so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others.
SANSA: What others?
MYRANDA: I shouldn’t gossip. It’s good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
SANSA: What others?
MYRANDA: Let’s see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith’s daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don’t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.
SANSA: Hunt?
MYRANDA: Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it’s your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?
SANSA: What was your name again?
MYRANDA: Myranda.
SANSA: And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can’t frighten me.
MYRANDA: Are you done with your bath, my lady?
SANSA: Go. I can finish on my own.
EXT. SANSA’S ROOM - MORNING
Snow falls outside. There is a knock on the door.
SANSA: Yes?
INT. SANSA’S ROOM
Theon enters.
THEON: I’ve come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?
SANSA: No.
THEON: Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.
SANSA: I’m not touching you.
THEON: Please. He’ll punish me.
SANSA: Do you think I care what he does to you.
Sansa leaves the room without Theon.
EXT. THE GODSWOOD
Sansa walks to the Godswood with Theon. Ramsay is waiting alongside his father and with the Bolton men forming an aisle. Roose walks forward.
ROOSE: Who comes before the Old Gods this night?
THEON: Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?
Ramsay steps forward.
RAMSAY: Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?
THEON: Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father’s ward.
ROOSE: Lady Sansa, will you take this man?
Long pause. Cut to Ramsay, Walda, and Myranda. Sansa steps forward.
SANSA: I take this man.
Ramsay smiles.
INT. RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS
Theon opens the door for Ramsay and Sansa.
RAMSAY: Are you pleased my lady?
Sansa nods.
RAMSAY: Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you’re still a virgin.
SANSA: Yes.
RAMSAY: Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
SANSA: Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me.
RAMSAY: You’re not lying to me?
SANSA: No, my lord.
RAMSAY: Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think?
SANSA: Yes sir.
Ramsay kisses her.
RAMSAY: Good. Now take off your clothes.
Theon starts to leave.
RAMSAY: Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. (to Sansa) Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.
Sansa starts to undo her coat. Theon closes the door.
RAMSAY: Reek? I told you to watch.
Theon looks up.
RAMSAY: You’ve known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK
Men of the Night’s Watch prepare the horses as snow falls on Castle Black. Thormund is brought before Jon. Jon looks at him, nods, and a Brother removes Tormund’s chains. Thormund raises his free hands to Ser Alliser in the distance and is carried away. Jon walks over to Alliser.
JON: First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.
ALLISER: Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings.
Cut to Olly watching their conversation from afar.
JON: As always, thank you for your honesty.
Jon walks away to Sam.
SAM: Safe travels, Lord Commander.
JON: Thank you, Sam.
SAM: Oh, and…
Sam hands him a wrapped package. Jon opens it to find a sword.
SAM: It’s Dragonglass. It’s what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don’t need them.
JON: Me too.
They hug. Jon gets on a horse next to Tormund and rides away.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - MAESTOR AEMON’S ROOM
AEMON: There he is. That laugh. Egg! Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember about him.
Gilly looks at Sam, confused.
SAM: His little brother, Aegon. He became king.
AEMON: And before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one.
Aemon’s mood changes, he suddenly becomes panicked.
AEMON: Get him south, Gillyflower. Before it’s too late.
INT. WINTERFELL - HALLWAY
Theon carries a food plate across the hall. He arrives at a door and unlocks it.
INT. SANSA’S ROOM
Sansa is sleeping. Theon approaches and closes a window, waking Sansa.
SANSA: Theon, wait.
THEON: Not Theon, my lady. Reek.
Sansa sits up in bed, revealing cuts and bruises along her arms.
SANSA: Help me.
THEON: You’re his wife now.
SANSA: Theon
THEON: Do what he says. Do what he says or he’ll hurt you.
SANSA: He already hurts me every night. All day I’m locked in this room and every night he comes. It can’t be worse.
THEON: It can. It can always be worse.
Sansa stands up.
SANSA: What did he do to you?
THEON: Please…
Theon goes for the door. Sansa runs to the door and blocks him from leaving.
SANSA: You betrayed my family!
THEON: I’m sorry. I’m sorry!
SANSA: You have to help me!
THEON: He’ll see us. You don’t know him.
SANSA: My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they’ll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon.
THEON: Reek, my lady, Reek!
SANSA: Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me.
Theon hesitates, nods, and exits the room.
EXT. WINTERFELL
Theon walks across Winterfell with the Broken Tower in the background.
INT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER
Theon climbs the stairs to the top floor. He opens the door to see Ramsay eating.
RAMSAY: Yes, Reek?

INT. CASTLE BLACK - AEMON’S ROOM
Close-up on a candle, then Gilly’s baby.
AEMON: Egg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg!
GILLY: Get some sleep, Sam. You’ll have to speak for him tomorrow.
SAM: You don’t know that.
GILLY: Get some sleep. I’ll watch over him.
SAM: I’ll stay too. He’s always been good to me. I can’t leave him now.
AEMON (PANICKED): Egg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old
EXT. CASTLE BLACK
Close up on Maester Aemon’s funeral pyre.
SAM: His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King’s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended.
BROTHERS: And now his watch has ended.
Sam lights the pyre, then hands the torch to Alliser, who lights it then passes it along.
ALLISER: You’re losing all your friends, Tarly.
Sam looks up to see a Brother glaring at him.
EXT. WINTERFELL
Sansa walks up to Ramsay.
RAMSAY: My beautiful wife.
He kisses her.
RAMSAY: When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You’ve made me very happy.
They start walking down stairs. Sansa grabs a cross in the snow before they leave.
RAMSAY: Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He’s a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He’s hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army’s out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I’ll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You’ll be my Lady and Wardeness.
SANSA: But isn’t your step mother pregnant?
RAMSAY: What of it?
SANSA: What happens if she has a boy?
RAMSAY: Then I’ll have a baby brother.
SANSA: But he’ll be the heir.
RAMSAY: I’m Lord Bolton’s eldest son.
SANSA: But you’re a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim.
Ramsay stops walking.
RAMSAY: I’ve been naturalized by a royal decree of--
SANSA: Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.
They start walking again.
RAMSAY: Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.
Sansa looks shocked.
RAMSAY: You didn’t know? Yes, he’s done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady.
EXT. WINTERFELL
The woman who visited Sansa’s chamber previously is out in the open, flayed to death.
RAMSAY: Your Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave.
Cut to Theon looking terrified.
RAMSAY: Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.
Sansa continues to look at the woman, horrified.
RAMSAY: Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It’s far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.
He kisses her on the cheek then she is carried away.
EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP
Daavos rides through the camp on horseback, observing the men as they cough and huddle around each other. The snow is falling hard.
INT. STANNIS’ CAMP - STANNIS’ TENT
DAAVOS: 40 horses died in the night. We’ll lose more come sunset. We’re running out of food. We can’t open the supply line until the snow clears.
STANNIS: What else?
DAAVOS: The Stormcrows rode off last night.
STANNIS: 500 men.
Daavos nods. Stannis removes a Baratheon piece from his chess board.
STANNIS: Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold.
DAAVOS: We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won’t be marching anywhere in this weather.
STANNIS: And?
DAAVOS: This isn’t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.
STANNIS: I retreated from King’s Landing, Ser Daavos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”
DAAVOS: Your Grace..
STANNIS: Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it’s a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last.
DAAVOS: It’s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.
STANNIS: This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we’ve lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,
Daavos looks to Melisandre, lurking in the back of the tent.
DAAVOS: Your Grace. (leaves)
STANNIS (TO MELISANDRE): I’ve trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years.
MELISANDRE: You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow.
STANNIS: I don’t know what I saw.
MELISANDRE: You do know. Trust yourself.
STANNIS: And you, do you trust yourself?
MELISANDRE: I trust in the Lord.
STANNIS: Are you sure?
MELISANDRE: I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
She flips the Bolton pieces over on Stannis’ board.
MELISANDRE: But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
STANNIS: We don’t have Robert’s bastard here.
MELISANDRE: No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins.
STANNIS: Have you lost your mind?
MELISANDRE: Do you doubt me still? After all that you’ve seen?
STANNIS: There must be another way. Leeches or something.
MELISANDRE: There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.
STANNIS: She’s my daughter.
Melisandre embraces him.
STANNIS: Get out.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - WASH ROOM
Gilly washes clothes. Two Brothers walk into the room.
DERRYK: The beauty from beyond The Wall.
Gilly starts walking away.
BRAND: Where are you going, huh? Aren’t we better looking than the fat man?
DERRYK: The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she’s the only girl here?
BRAND: Even in White Harbor, I’d want a kiss.
DERRYK: Come on love, give us a kiss.
GILLY: Leave me alone.
DERRYK: If you were my girl I wouldn’t leave you alone.
BRAND: One little kiss.
DERRYK: Come on, give him a kiss.
BRAND: A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.
She tries to walk away. They slap the laundry basket out of her hands and trap her.
BRAND: There’s no need to be rude.
DERRYK: We just want a little affection.
She slaps Derryk across the face. Sam enters the room and pulls out his sword.
SAM: Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
BRAND: Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?
DERRYK: Look at his hands shaking.
SAM: Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door.
Derryk throws her to the floor.
SAM: I’m warning you.
DERRYK: Come on! Come on!
Sam swings the sword. It is deflected and he is subdued. Derryk punches him in the gut then starts kicking him.
DERRYK: You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. (to Gilly) He’s your hero. He’s a hog!
GILLY: Leave him alone!
She charges at Derryk. He subdues her.
DERRYK: Stubborn little wilding bitch aren’t ya?
Brand kicks Sam in the face.
GILLY: Sam! Sam! Sam!
He punches Sam repeatedly in the face until he seems to lose consciousness.
BRAND: Alright. Hold still.
They both hold Gilly down as she screams. Sam gets back up.
SAM: I said get your hands off her.
BRAND: You’re gonna get yourself killed.
DERRYK: Roll over. Jon Snow’s not here to save you.
SAM: I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I’ll take my chances with you.
Ghost shows up and growls at the brothers. They sprint out of the room. Sam falls to his knees.
GILLY: Sam!
SAM: I’m alright.
GILLY: You’re not.
SAMMY: Just a bit woozy.
Sam collapses onto his side.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - BEDROOM
Gilly washes out Sam’s wounds with a wash cloth.
GILLY: The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.
SAM: I will not. They would’ve… I don’t know what they would have done
GILLY: I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn’t come.
SAM: No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
GILLY: Don’t be stupid Sam, you’re not a fighter.
SAM: What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
GILLY: Just promise me that whatever happens you’ll take care of little Sam.
SAM: Of course I will. And I’ll take care of you, too.
GILLY: I need more water.
She gets up. Sam grabs her arm.
SAM: Stay. Please.
Gilly gets on top of Sam and starts kissing him. She gets back up, and puts her hands around his neck and starts kissing him again.
GILLY: Am I hurting you?
He shakes his head no.
GILLY: Are you sure?
Sam nods yes. She pulls his pants down, pulls her dress up, and starts riding him.
SAM: Oh. Oh my.
EXT. VOLANTIS - SLAVER’S AUCTION
The slaves are carried up to the auction stage. One of Malko’s men whips Tyrion.
MALKO: A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one’s a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.
A hand goes up.
MALKO: 13. Do I have 14?
A hand goes up.
MALKO: 15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?
A man in the front who has been studying Jorah intently raises his hand.
SLAVE BUYER: 20.
MALKO: Sold!
Jorah is taken away.
TYRION: Wait! You have to buy me as well.
BUYER: Why?
TYRION: We’re a team. I’m a great fighter, too.
The crowd laughs.
MALKO: He’s funny. You have to give him that.
The man holding Tyrion’s chains laughs at him. Tyrion yanks his chains, pulling the man to the ground, and starts beating on him with the chains as the crowd roars. Tyrion kicks him in the head then looks to the buyer.
BUYER: Alright. He’s funny.
He hands Malko coins.
TYRION: Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
BUYER: Yes.
TYRION: My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…
The buyer hits Tyrion in the mouth then tosses him a few coins.
BUER: Here’s your wages, funny man. It’ll last the rest of your life.
INT. MEREEN - DAENERYS’ CHAMBER
DAARIO: How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
DAENERYS: Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that.
DAARIO: I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
DAENERYS: Are you jealous?
DAARIO: Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
DAENERYS: I do.
Daario laughs.
DAARIO: You’re right. My motivations are entirely impure.
They start kissing.
DAARIO: Doesn’t make me wrong.
DAENERYS: You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice.
DAARIO: Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
DAENERYS: So what else can I do?
DAARIO: Marry me instead.
DAENERYS: Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t.
DAARIO: Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like.
DAENERYS: No. I can’t
DAARIO: Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free.
Daenerys sits up in bed.
DAARIO: I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?
DAENERYS: Of course
DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.
DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.
DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.
INT. KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
OLENNA: You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got.
HIGH SPARROW: It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit.
OLENNA: You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
SPARROW: You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
OLENNA: Don’t spar with me little fellow.
The High Septon gets up.
SPARROW: For me, it’s the knees. You?
OLENNA: Hips.
SPARROW: Huh.
OLENNA: A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her.
SPARROW: The people always do the dirty work.
OLENNA: Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away.
SPARROW: A useful talent.
OLENNA: I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter.
SPARROW: Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished.
The High Sparrow heads for the door.
OLENNA: Don’t you walk away from me.
SPARROW: You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna.
OLENNA: What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
The High Sparrow laughs.
OLENNA: What then?
SPARROW: I IMAGINE THIS IS STRANGE FOR YOU. EVERYONE YOU MEET HAS A HIDDEN MOTIVE, AND YOU PRIDE YOURSELF ON SLITTING IN AND OUT. BUT I’M TELLING YOU A SIMPLE TRUTH: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice.
OLENNA: How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
SPARROW: By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own.
OLENNA (WITH CONTEMPT): I’ve read the seven pointed star.
SPARROW: Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
OLENNA: Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?
SPARROW: Yes. The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally.
OLENNA: If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,
SPARROW: Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…
He walks out of the room.
EXT. SEPT OF BAELOR
SQUIRE: Lady Olenna.
He hands her a letter with Baelish's mockingbird sigil.
INT. KING’S LANDING - DINING ROOM
CERSEI: Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.
TOMMEN: She’s in a prison cell and there’s nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there’s nothing I can do!
Tommen walks to the window. Cersei joins him.
CERSEI: No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.
Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had. You cannot blame yourself for fate. Your father, your brother, your grandfather-- I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world. Kissed their heads after they'd gone.
TOMMEN: I’ll call in the army. I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I’ll start a war if I have to.
CERSEI: You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
TOMMEN: I love her. I love her. I can’t help her.
CERSEI: We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
TOMMEN: I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
CERSEI: Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
CERSEI: Your happiness is all I want in this world
TOMMEN: I know.
CERSEI: No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy.
Cersei embraces him and starts crying.
INT. DORNE
Jaime is being kept in a closely monitored room.
AREO: Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess’s wellbeing.
Areo brings Myrcella into the room.
MYRCELLA: You looked different when I left. You had more hair.
JAIME: And more hands. How’s Trystane?
MYRCELLA: He’ll be alright.
JAIME: I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way.
MYRCELLA: Why is it happening at all?
JAIME: Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home.
MYRCELLA: This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn’t want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?
JAIME: It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
MYRCELLA: It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple. I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here.
JAIME: I don’t understand.
MYRCELLA: Of course you don’t! You don’t know me!
Myrcella leaves the room.
INT. DORNE - CELL
BRONN (SINGING): Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife!
In the adjacent cell to Bronn, Tyene claps as the other Snakes glare at her.
TYENE: He’s got a good voice.
OBARA: We’re lucky he’s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
BRONN: It’s against my code to hurt a woman.
OBARA: It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
BRONN: I wouldn’t say you beat me.
TYENE: How’s your arm?
BRONN: Wonderful. Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
TYENE: You think you’re leaving Dorne?
BRONN: No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
TYENE: Thank you.
BRONN: I said Dornish women. I didn’t say you.
TYENE: I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?
BRONN: I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
TYENE: Name one more beautiful than I am.
BRONN: Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous...
Tyene takes one of her breasts out of her tunic.
TYENE: There was a what? In King’s Landing you were saying.
BRONN: Was I?
TYENE: There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
Tyene takes both her breasts out.
BRONN: Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier.
TYENE: How’s your arm now?
BRONN: You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
Tyene undoes the rest of her tunic.
TYENE: And how about your head?
BRONN: My head… You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in…
As Bronn scans her naked body, his vision starts to blur and he collapses to the ground.
TYENE: Your nose is bleeding.
BRONN: It’s nothing. It’s the dry air.
TYENE: My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.
She holds a tiny blue cap up to Bronn from her cell.
TYENE: The only antidote. Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world?
Bronn gasps for breath.
TYENE: Sorry? Who?
BRONN (FINALLY): You.
TYENE: Don’t drop it.
Tyene tosses it into his cell and Bronn downs it.
TYENE: I think you’re very handsome as well.
INT. KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL
Littlefinger peers at the Great Sept of Baelor through the window. The brothel is destroyed, with many seven-pointed stars scribbled on the floor, walls, and artwork.
BAELISH: I’m sorry about the locale.
OLENNA: No you’re not.
BAELISH: It felt like the safest place.
OLENNA: Not for your clientele, clearly.
BAELISH: It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them.
OLENNA: You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?
BAELISH: The past is the past. The future is all that’s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
OLENNA: Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong.
BAELISH: I promise you..
OLENNA: I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?
BAELISH: Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing. I dared not refuse her.
OLENNA: And what did she want?
BAELISH: A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you.
OLENNA: What kind of gift?
BAELISH: The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
INT. MEREEN - FIGHTING PITS - WAITING AREA
Gladiators prepare their swords and armor.
SLAVE OWNER: Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games.

The fighters enter the pit.

The slave owner sees Daenerys and runs in front of her and Hizdahr.

DAENERYS: I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.

A giant man sees Tyrion sawing at his chains. He raises a giant sword above Tyrion’s head, but comes down on the chain, freeing Tyrion. Tyrion nods in thanks.
EXT. FIGHTING PIT
Daenerys is watching intently now. Jorah is the last man standing. He walks up to Daenerys and Hizdahr and removes his helmet. She stares at him for a moment.
DAENERYS: Get him out of my sight.
Her men grab Jorah.
JORAH: Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift.
TYRION (O.S.): It’s true. He has.
Tyrion enters the pit.
DAENERYS: Who are you?
TYRION: I am the gift. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.
Cut to Dany in shock and deep thought after hearing his name.
INT. KING’S LANDING - BLACK CELL
Cersei enters Margaery’s cell.
CERSEI: This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.
MARGAERY: I know you did this.
CERSEI: We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
MARGAERY: Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid. Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.
CERSEI: You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.
MARGAERY: I don’t want to see you again.
CERSEI: I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.
MARGAERY: Leave.
CERSEI: Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever.
Margaery throws the medicine at Cersei.
MARGAERY: Get out you hateful bitch!
CERSEI: Sleep well, sister.
Cersei walks out smiling. She is taken to High Septon’s room by a Sparrow.
INT. GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL
HIGH SPARROW (TO SPARROW): Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?
CERSEI: Yes.
SPARROW: And?
CERSEI: Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
SPARROW: Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
CERSEI: Who will stand judge?
SPARROW: Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
CERSEI: Will you be one of them?
SPARROW: I will.
CERSEI: If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
SPARROW: Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy.
CERSEI: What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
SPARROW: It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.
CERSEI: Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
SPARROW: Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
CERSEI: I think I may have heard at one point.
SPARROW: Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
The High Septon gestures to a stone altar with seven-pointed stars engraved into it.
SPARROW: Who carved this altar do you know?
CERSEI: I’m afraid i don’t.
SPARROW: No one does. There’s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains. Something simple, solid, and true. The Tyrell’s finery will be stripped away. Their lives knocked down, their true hearts laid bare for all to see. And so it will be for all of us, high and low alike. What will we find when we strip away your finery?
The High Septon stares intently at Cersei.
SPARROW: A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird.
Cersei gives a faint laugh.
SPARROW: And he has much to say about you.
Lancell enters the room and stands next to the High Septon. Cersei goes for the door and is blocked.
CERSEI: Move. Let me go immediately.
Cersei is grabbed and carried away from the room.
CERSEI (O.S.): You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
INT. BLACK CELL
Cersei is thrown into the cell. She looks up at the people who put her there.
CERSEI: Look at me. Look at my face. It’s the last thing you’ll see before you die.
The door slams closed and is bolted shut.
INT. STANNIS’S CAMP - MELISANDRE’S TENT
Melisandre looks at the icicles hanging outside her tent and sees that they are melting.

INT. STANNIS’S CAMP - STANNIS’S TENT
Stannis straps his armor on.
MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear.
STANNIS: We ride for Winterfell.
MELISANDRE: And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.
Melisandre wraps her arms around Stannis. He brushes her off then exits the tent. She follows after him.
INT. STANNIS’S CAMP
Stannis walks by his men as they prepare for battle. One soldier approaches him.
SOLDIER: Your Grace.
STANNIS: Prepare to form up.
SOLDIER: Your Grace.
The soldier waits for a response from Stannis.
STANNIS: Tell me.
SOLDIER: The men. Many deserted before dawn.
STANNIS: How many?
SOLDIER: Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses.
Stannis is speechless. He looks to Melisandre who appears even more devastated than he. Another soldier comes up to Stannis.
SOLDIER 2: Your Grace?
STANNIS: Speak up. It can’t be worse than mutiny.
The man is silent.
EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE STANNIS’S CAMP
Stannis is led by his men to a tree. Stannis looks up and sees Selyse hanging from it. Stannis takes a long look but tries not to reveal his emotions.
STANNIS: Cut her down.
The men cut the noose and bring her to the ground.
SOLDIER: Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
Stannis seethes but says nothing.
STANNIS: Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
Stannis walks from the woods back to camp.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY
JON: He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.
SAM: So what are you gonna do?
JON: I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.
SAM: But… the Dragonglass?
JON (SHAKES HIS HEAD): No one’s ever getting that back, now. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.
SAM (CONFUSED): But… you killed a White Walker.
JON: With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
SAM: He’s made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
JON: Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How’s it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles)
SAM: You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn’t winning any elections back then.
JON: Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer.
Jon and Sam clink glasses and drink. Sam looks to Jon.
JON: What?
SAM: I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That’s what I’m meant to be, not this.
JON: I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?
SAM: Well, there’s Edd.
Jon gives Sam a look.
SAM: I’ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon’s gone. The Citadel has the world’s greatest library. I’ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.
Jon stares at Sam, saying nothing.
SAM: If Gilly stays here then she’ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I’ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I’ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I’d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.
Jon inhales, exhales, then nods somberly. Sam smiles.
SAM: Thank you.
JON: You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.
SAM: They’ll bloody try.
Jon looks at Sam incredulously.
JON: Sam?
SAM: What?
JON: Sam…
Sam smiles.
JON: You’ve just been beaten half to death. How did you--
SAM (SMILING): Very carefully.
Jon smiles and lets out a small laugh.
JON: I’m glad the end of the world’s working out for someone.
They sit in silence for a moment.
SAM: I’ll come back.
JON (RAISES A GLASS): To your return.
SAM: To my return.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK
Sam, Gilly, and little Sam mount the horses. Sam looks up to see Jon watching from the top of his steps.They exchange a wave, and then Sam begins riding out of Castle Black.

Podrick returns to he and Brienne’s camp with firewood and dead rabbits. He hears screaming then looks down to see Stannis’s army marching for Winterfell. He drops the wood and rabbits and sprints back to Brienne.
Brienne is staring at the Broken Tower.
PODRICK: My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
BRIENNE: How do you know it’s Stannis?
PODRICK: He’s carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I’ll never forget it.

Sansa approaches the Tower with a candle in hand.
EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL - HILL

EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL
STANNIS: Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
SOLDIER: There’s not going to be a siege, Your Grace.
Stannis looks to the distance and sees the Bolton army racing towards him as they come over the top of a hill.
EXT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER
Sansa looks down at the ensuing battle from the top of the Broken Tower with a candle in the window.
EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL

EXT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER
Sansa watches from the window as the fight begins. She walks away from the window.
EXT. WINTERFELL - WOODS
Pan across the ground to reveal all but one of Stannis’s men are slaughtered alongside various banners and shields with his sigil. Stannis hobbles away from these men, using his sword as a crutch. Two Bolton men arrive on horse and kill the lone survivor of Stannis’s men. They charge at Stannis, one slices his leg, but he kills them both with a dagger and sword then falls to the ground.
Stannis leans onto a tree and groans. He looks down to his bleeding leg with a resigned look, then looks up to the sound of a horse riding.
STANNIS: Bolton has women fighting for him.
Cut up to Brienne of Tarth.
BRIENNE: I do not fight for the Boltons. I’m Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
Stannis is silent for a long moment.
STANNIS: I did.
Brienne approaches him and unsheathes her sword.
BRIENNE: In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?
STANNIS: Go on, do your duty.
Brienne unsheathes her sword, pulls it back, swings forward, and--
CUT TO: EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD
Ramsay plunges his sword into a survivor. Then he surveys the corpses on the battlefield.
RAMSAY: Looks like we’re done here.
Ramsay heads back towards his horse but sees one of Stannis’s men is survive, and is attempting to crawl away.
SURVIVOR: I surrender. I surrender!
RAMSAY: And I accept your surrender.
Ramsay plunges his sword into the man then pulls it out and wipes the blood off.
RAMSAY (TO SQUIRE): Let’s head back. My wife must be lonely.
Pan out to reveal the bodies on the battlefield.

EXT. WINTERFELL - BALCONY
Sansa rushes through a door towards the exit. She finds Myranda and Theon waiting for her, with Myranda’s bow drawn.
MYRANDA: My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
THEON: Go with her. Please.
SANSA: I know what Ramsay is. I know what he’ll do to me. (looks to Theon) If I’m going to die, let it happen while there’s some of me left.
MYRANDA: Die? (lowers the bow) Who said anything about dying? You can’t die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn’t need all of you. Just the parts he’ll use to make his heir. Until you’ve given him a boy or two and he’s finished using them. (raises bow) He’s got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?
Sansa says nothing.
MYRANDA: You’re leaving it to me? Good. Let’s begin.
She draws her arrow back. Just as she goes to release it, Theon tackles her into a wall, causing the arrow to miss Sansa. They struggle for a moment.
MYRANDA: Stop! Stop!
Theon throws her over the edge, killing her on impact. As Sansa and Theon go to the edge to inspect the body, a horn begins to blare.
MAN: Open the gates!
Bolton men return from the battle and ride through the gates to Winterfell.
THEON: He’s coming back.
Theon grabs Sansa’s hand and leads her along the walls. They climb to the top of the wall and look down to see a pile of snow at the bottom. Theon offers his hand to Sansa, she takes it, and they leap off of the wall.
INT. BRAAVOS - BROTHEL
Meryn Trant looks to 3 young girls in front of him and tightens his grip on the stick in his hand. He walks behind the first one and whips her, she starts crying. He does the same to the second and she cries as well. He walks up to the third girl, whose face is hidden by her hair, and whips her in the back. She doesn’t react. He whips her harder in the side and doesn’t get a reaction. He whips her a third time across the face and the girl still doesn’t make a sound.
MERYN: I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.
The two other girls flee the room. The third removes her hair to show an unknown face. Meryn punches her in the stomach. She falls to the ground doubled over. Meryn smiles but loses the smile when he sees she is reaching for something. The girl pulls off her face, revealing she is Arya, and leaps towards Trant, stabbing him in the eye. She stabs his other eye then gags him with his shirt as he screams. He grabs at her but she stabs him in the chest until he rolls on his side.
ARYA: You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I’ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I’m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?
Trant struggles to make a noise through the gag.
ARYA: I can’t hear you.
She stabs him in the stomach.
ARYA: You know who I am. I’m Arya Stark.
A look of surprise comes across Trant’s face, he grunts, and then Arya stabs him in the back. She removes the gag.
ARYA: Do you know who you are?
Trant whimpers.
ARYA: You’re no one. You’re nothing.
She slowly slits his throat and he keels over.
INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - FACE ROOM
Arya walks into the room holding the face of the girl she wore to the brothel. She returns it to where she took it from.
JAQEN: A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
WAIF: I was right about her.
JAQEN: You were.
WAIF: You’re not ready. Not at all.
The waif grabs Arya and holds her in front of Jaqen.
JAQEN: That man’s life wasn’t yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.
Jaqen holds up the same vial he gave to Arya to give to the Thin Man. The waif holds Arya’s face up near the vial as she struggles.
JAQEN: Only death can pay for life.
Jaqen drinks the vial and then falls straight to the ground.
ARYA: No! No! No, you don’t die! Don’t die! (sobs)
WAIF: Why are you crying?
ARYA: He was my friend.
WAIF: No he wasn’t. Didn’t you listen to him?
JAQEN (O.S.): He was no one.
Arya turns to see a man looking identical to Jaqen standing behind her.
ARYA: But if you’re… (looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead) Who’s this?
JAQEN: No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
Arya reaches and pulls off the Jaqen face, revealing the face of an old man.
JAQEN: The faces are for no one.
Arya pulls off the old man face to reveal a younger man’s face.
JAQEN: You are still someone.
Arya pulls off the young man’s face to reveal a different old man.
JAQEN: And to someone…
Arya pulls off multiple faces, revealing the face of multiple different men.
JAQEN: ...the faces are as good as poison.
Arya pulls off the final face and sees her own face staring back at her.
ARYA: I can’t see!
Arya’s vision begins to blur until the screen goes black.
ARYA: What’s happening?! What’s happening?!
EXT. DORNE - DOCK
Myrcella kisses Prince Doran.
DORAN (TO JAIME): I wish you a safe journey home.
JAIME: Thank you.
Doran looks to Ellaria and nods. She walks up to Myrcella.
ELLARIA: Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
Ellaria kisses Myrcella on the lips, holding the kiss then rubbing her lips. She nods to Jaime and Jaime nods back. Jaime helps Myrcella into the boat.
BRONN: Maybe I’ll come visit you sometime.
TYENE: Maybe I’ll come visit you.
BRONN: Don’t wait too long. I’ve a noble woman to marry back home.
TYENE (LEANS IN): You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy. (bites his ear)
JAIME (TO BRONN): Whenever you’re ready, My Lord.
Bronn nods to Tyene and the Snakes, then heads to the boat.
INT. SEA OF DORNE - BOAT
Myrcella looks down at her lion necklace.
JAIME: Try not to lose it this time.
MYRCELLA: I’ll never take it off again.
JAIME: I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
MYRCELLA: Do you think mother will like him.
JAIME: If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will.
MYRCELLA (LAUGHING): And you really believe that?
JAIME (SMILES): Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
MYRCELLA: She likes you.
JAIME: I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.
MYRCELLA: No you don’t.
JAIME: What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say…
MYRCELLA: I know what you’re trying to say.
JAIME: No. I’m afraid you don’t.
Myrcella stands up and looks Jaime in the eyes.
MYRCELLA: I do.
She takes his good hand in hers.
MYRCELLA: I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I’m glad. I’m glad that you’re my father.
Jaime looks shocked but happy. They embrace. She releases the hug and smiles at Jaime, with blood beginning to trickle out her nose.
JAIME: Myrcella?
The bleeding gets worse.
JAIME: Myrcella?!
Myrcella collapses in Jaime’s arms, blood streaming down her face.
JAIME: Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
CUT TO: EXT. DORNE - DOCK
Ellaria stares at Jaime’s ship from the dock. Blood begins to trickle out of her nose and splatter the floor. Tyene hands her a rag for the blood and she wipes it away then thrrows the rag away. She opens the antidote and drinks it down. She and the Sand Snakes begin walking from the dock.
INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID
Tyrion, Daario, and Jorah sit on the steps in Dany’s throne room.
TYRION (TO JORAH): You love her, don’t you? How could you not. Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.
DAARIO: Does he always talk so much?
Jorah nods. Missandei brings Grey Worm into the room, with bandages around his torso.
GREY WORM: Jorah the Andal.
JORAH: Torgo Nudho.
GREY WORM: You should not be here.
DAARIO: No, but he is.
GREY WORM: Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
DAARIO: Our queen would be dead if not for him.
MISSANDEI (VALYRIAN): It’s true. And I would be dead if not for the… (look at Tyrion) little man.
TYRION (VALYRIAN): Dwarf. I believe that’s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
MISSANDEI: (Valyrian) A bit “rusty”.
TYRION: (Valyrian) “Rusty” (Common Tongue) Thank you.
GREY WORM: I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
DAARIO: You missed a good scrap.
JORAH: None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
TYRION: He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go.
JORAH: We? You’re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
TYRION: And I intend to help her do it.
JORAH: You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
TYRION: You betrayed her!
JORAH: Careful now.
TYRION: And she exiled you, twice, I believe?
JORAH: The second time thanks to you.
TYRION: Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont.
DAARIO: (gestures to Tyrion) He’s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her.
TYRION: Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.
JORAH: If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
DAARIO (TO TYRION): Forgive me, but why would we bring you?
TYRION: Pardon me?
DAARIO: Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
TYRION: Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--
DAARIO: Can you fight?
TYRION: I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.
DAARIO: Are you good on a horse?
TYRION: Middling.
DAARIO: So mainly you talk?
TYRION: And drink. I’ve survived so far.
DAARIO: Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.
JORAH: He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
DAARIO: They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.
GREY WORM: I’ll come with you. I’ll find our queen.
MISSANDEI: You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
GREY WORM: I am.
DAARIO: He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.
MISSANDEI: It’s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half.
DAARIO: And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.
Tyrion walks down the steps towards Missandei and Grey Worm. They exchange uncertain glances with each other.
EXT. MEEREEN - BALCONY
Tyrion stands in the place where Dany had Mossador executed and watches Jorah and Daario ride out of the city.
VOICE (O.S.): Hello, old friend.
Tyrion turns to see Varys on the balcony next to him.
VARYS: I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
TYRION: I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.
VARYS: The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.
TYRION: Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?
VARYS: Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
TYRION: If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
VARYS: If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?
Tyrion looks up to Varys with a slight smile.
TYRION: I did miss you.
VARYS: Oh, I know.
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU
Dany looks to Drogon who is lying down in a ring full of bones.
DAENERYS: We have to go home.
Drogon lies down and grunts.
DAENERYS: My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?
Daenerys pets his nose but gets no response.
DAENERYS: How far did you carry me? (surveys the area)
Drogon begins turning away from her to lick at his wounds.
DAENERYS: Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.
She climbs back on his back, but he hisses and bucks her off, then goes to sleep.
DAENERYS: Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper.
Dany begins walking across the plateau to explore. A horse gallops in the distance. Camera cuts to reveal the pony-tail of a Dothraki. Three more Dothraki men arrive on horseback. Daenerys drops her ring to the ground. Another group of Dothraki arrives, and then the rest of the khalasar. They begin circling around Daenerys, howling.
INT. CERSEI’S CELL
Cersei is huddled in the corner. She shudders as the door opens.
SEPTA: Confess. Confess.
Cersei looks up to the Septa.
INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM
Cersei is knelt before the High Sparrow in the room where she was taken away.
CERSEI: I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--
HIGH SPARROW: You wish to make a confession?
CERSEI: Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?
SPARROW: Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
CERSEI: The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess.
SPARROW: Name him.
CERSEI: Lancel Lannister.
SPARROW: Your cousin. And the King’s squire.
CERSEI: I was lonely and afraid.
SPARROW: You had a husband.
CERSEI: A husband of whoring every chance he got.
SPARROW: His sins do not pardon your own.
CERSEI: May the gods forgive me.
SPARROW: Other men?
CERSEI: No.
SPARROW: No others?
CERSEI: No.
SPARROW: Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
CERSEI: I do.
SPARROW: There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
CERSEI: A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.
SPARROW: Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.
CERSEI: Trial? I have confessed?
SPARROW: To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
CERSEI: I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please.
SPARROW: You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.
CERSEI: Thank you. Thank you.
SPARROW: The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.
CERSEI: I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.
SPARROW: Good.
CERSEI: Am I free to go?
SPARROW: After your atonement.
CERSEI: My atonement?
INT. CERSEI’S CELL
Cersei is stripped naked and has the dirt washed off of her by the septas. After they scrub her clean, they sit her down and begin chopping her hair away with a knife. They leave her naked, with short hair and a bloody scalp, and then shut the door on her.
EXT. KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
Cersei is carried to the top of the steps, in front of a massive crowd of King’s Landing citizens.
SPARROW: A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement.
The septas remove her robe. She stands naked before the citizens of King’s Landing, who gasp. They force her to start walking down the stairs.
SEPTA: Shame. Shame. Shame. (rings bell)
The septa repeats “Shame. Shame. Shame.” and rings the bell through the duration of Cersei’s walk. Cersei is escorted by the Sparrows through the crowd of people. Silence at first, but once one man yells “Cunt!”, she begins to be heckled.
CROWD: Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!
They begin pelting her with food. A prostitute runs in front of Cersei with her breasts out.
WOMAN: I’ve had half as many cocks as the queen!
The sparrows force her out of Cersei’s way. A man with his penis out runs in front of her later in the walk.
MAN: Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!
As Cersei approaches the end of her walk things get more violent. A man spits directly in her face, and a Sparrow has to beat a woman with a club as she charges Cersei. She is knocked to her knees at the end of her walk, but gets back to her feet when she sees the Red Keep in the distance. She finally reaches the end of the walk of atonement, and enters the Red Keep, sobbing.
INT. RED KEEP
Kevan Lannister, Grand Maester Pycelle, Qyburn, and the Lannister guards wait for her. Qyburn rushes to cover her naked body with a blanket as Cersei begins weeping.
QYBURN: Your Grace. It’s good to have you back. Come. We’ll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.
Cut to her bloody feet. We hear two giant footsteps off screen.
QYBURN: May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.
A hulking man, who is revealed to have a blue face through the eye holes in his helm, walks over to Qyburn and Cersei. He takes Cersei in his arms.
QYBURN: If it please Your Grace, he’s taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace’s enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK
Jon and Davos exit the elevator.
DAVOS: He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!
JON: We don’t have enough men to make any difference.
DAVOS: The wildlings will make a difference!
JON: The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--
DAVOS: You saved their bloody lives. If they’re going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.
JON: It’s not their fight!
The gates to Castle Black are opened and Melisandre arrives, alone and on horseback. Jon and Davos rush over to her.
JON: Stannis?
No response.
DAVOS: Shireen? The princess?
A long look but no response. Melisandre walks away from the two of them.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - JON’S ROOM
Jon goes through the various scrolls on his desk. Olly enters the room.
OLLY: Lord Commander. It’s one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he’s still alive.
JON (STANDS UP): Are you sure he’s talking about Benjen?
OLLY: Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.
Jon rushes out of his room down to the ground. He is met by Alliser.
ALLISER: Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.
JON: He could be lying.
ALLISER: Could be. There are ways to find out.
JON: Where is he?
ALLISER: Over there.
Jon walks past a group of Brothers holding torches. He sees a sign that reads “TRAITOR” when he passes them, and turns to see he is cornered. Alliser stabs him in the gut.
ALLISER: For the Watch.
Another Brother stabs him.
BROTHER: For the Watch.
A third Brother stabs him.
BROTHER: For the Watch.
A fourth brother stabs him.
BROTHER: For the Watch.
A fifth brother stabs him.
BROTHER: For the Watch.
Jon falls to his knees, struggling but still alive. Olly walks up to Jon.
JON: Olly…
Olly stabs him.
OLLY: For the Watch.
Jon stays on his knees, then falls backwards. The Brothers walk away from him. Jon lays on the ground, expressionless. A puddle of blood spreads to the top of the screen.
[First scene opens with three Rangers riding through a tunnel, leaving the Wall, and going into the woods. (Eerie music in background) One Ranger splits off and finds a campsite full of mutilated bodies, including a child hanging from a tree branch. A birds-eye view shows the bodies arranged in a shield-like pattern. The Ranger rides back to the other two.]
WAYMAR ROYCE: What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces.
WILL: I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
WAYMAR ROYCE: How close did you get?
WILL: Close as any man would.
GARED: We should head back to the wall.
ROYCE: Do the dead frighten you?
GARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.
ROYCE: You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
[GARED grumbles.]
WILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
ROYCE: It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again.
[WILL glares, but obeys. Sometime later, the three Rangers return to the campsite, which is now completely cleared.]
ROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
WILL: They were here.
GARED: See where they went.
[The three look around, swords drawn. They hear the wind and eerie calls. GARED finds a red cloth in the snow.]
ROYCE: What is it?
GARED: It’s …
[As he speaks, a CREATURE with glowing blue eyes rises behind ROYCE. ROYCE turns, the CREATURE strikes. The scene shifts to WILL, who hears a man crying out. The three horses stampede past him. He turns and sees someone standing very still in the distance. The figure turns – it’s the child who had been suspended in the tree, now with glowing blue eyes. WILL turns and runs.
GARED is also fleeing, and we hear strange growls and catch glimpses of the CREATURE. Both terrified RANGERS stop, some distance apart, to catch their breath. WILL sees a CREATURE behead GARED. WILL sinks to his knees and the CREATURE tosses GARED’S head to him.]
[Blackout / Opening credits]
[Riders from Winterfell come up behind a dazed WILL. The scene shifts to the castle, where BRAN is practicing archery and getting frustrated, under the eyes of JON SNOW and ROBB STARK. JON pats BRAN’S shoulder.]
JON: Go on. Father’s watching.
[We see NED and CATELYN STARK watching from above.]
JON: And your mother.
[Scene shifts to needlework practice with the girls inside the castle.]
SEPTA MORDANE (TO SANSA): Fine work, as always. Well done.
SANSA: Thank you.
SEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …
[As she murmurs to SANSA about the embroidery, ARYA struggles with her needlework and listens to the arrows hitting and the male laughter outside.]
[Outside, BRAN tries and misses again. Everyone laughs.]
NED: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
JON: Don’t think too much, Bran.
ROBB: Relax your bow arm.
[BRAN pulls the arrow back. An arrow hits the bullseye. BRAN (still with his arrow), JON, and ROBB turn in surprise to see ARYA, who curtsies after her perfect shot. ROBB and JON laugh as Bran takes out after ARYA.]
JON/ROBB: Quick, Bran, faster!
[RODRICK CASSEL and THEON GREYJOY approach NED and CATELYN on the balcony.]
CASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.
[NED grimaces.]
NED: Get the lads to saddle their horses.
[THEON departs.]
CATELYN: Do you have to?
NED: He swore an oath, Cat.
CASSEL: The law is law, my lady.
NED: Tell Bran he’s coming, too.
[CASSEL nods and departs.]
CATELYN: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
NED: He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
[NED departs. In the courtyard, ROBB and JON gather the arrows. CATELYN turns and glares down on JON. He looks at her and walks away.]
ROBB: Lad, go run back and get the rest.
[Scene shifts, and we see WILL being taken to the block.]
WILL (MUTTERING): White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.
[He and NED face each other.]
WILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry.
NED nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block. [NED draws Ice from a scabbard held by Theon.]
WILL (WHISPERING): Forgive me, lord.
[NED bows his head over ICE.]
NED: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …
JON (TO BRAN): Don’t look away.
NED: King of the Andals and the First Men …
JON: Father will know if you do.
NED: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
[NED swings ICE and beheads WILL. BRAN does not look away.]
JON: You did well.
[He walks away. ROBB turns and puts his arm around BRAN and they go to their horses together. NED approaches BRAN.]
NED: You understand why I did it?
BRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.
NED: But do you understand why I had to kill him?
BRAN: Our way is the old way?
NED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
BRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
NED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
BRAN: So he was lying?
NED: A madman sees what he sees.
[Scene shifts to a dead stag’s head. The Winterfell men gather on the bridge They see a ravaged deer before them.]
JON: What is it?
THEON: Mountain lion?
NED: There are no mountain lions in these woods.
[With swords out, they begin to search. NED finds a dead direwolf with antlers through her throat. Her pups are whimpering around her.]
THEON: It’s a freak.
NED: It’s a direwolf.
[NED and CASSEL glance at each other.]
NED: Tough old beast.
[He pulls out the antlers.]
ROBB: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
JON: Now there are five.
[Jon picks up a pup and offers it to BRAN.]
JON: You want to hold it?
BRAN: Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.
CASSEL: They don’t belong down here.
NED: Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.
THEON: Right. Give it here.
BRAN: NO!
ROBB (DISGUSTEDLY TO THEON): Put away your blade.
THEON: I take orders from your father, not you.
BRAN: Please, father!
NED: I’m sorry, Bran.
JON: Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
[Everyone looks at NED, BRAN with great hope.]
NED: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
[BRAN cradles his pup as JON hands more pups to ROBB.]
BRAN (TO JON): What about you?
JON: I’m not a Stark. Get on.
[JON walks away, pauses, and hears another whimper.]
ROBB: What is it?
[JON pulls up a white wolf pup.]
THEON: The runt of the litter. That one’s yours, Snow.
[Scene shifts to bells ringing at Kings Landing. In front of the Iron Throne, surrounded by druidical looking celebrants, lies the body of JON ARRYN. Up in the balcony, CERSEI watches the scene below as JAIME approaches.]
JAIME: AS YOUR BROTHER, I FEEL IT’S MY DUTY TO WARN YOU: You worry too much. It’s starting to show.
CERSEI: And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.
JAIME: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools.
CERSEI: What if Jon Arryn told someone?
JAIME: But who would he tell?
CERSEI: My husband.
JAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.
CERSEI: You should be the Hand of the king.
JAIME: That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
Scene shifts to a raven approaching Winterfell. [CATELYN crosses a busy courtyard and finds NED in the godswood.]
CATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
NED: You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.
CATELYN: I wonder if the old gods agree.
NED: It’s your gods with all the rules.
CATELYN: I am so sorry, my love.
NED: Tell me.
CATELYN: There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
NED: Your sister. The boy …
CATELYN: They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
NED: He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after.
CATELYN: You can always say no, Ned.
[Scene shifts to the Winterfell great hall where a great banquet is being prepared.]
CATELYN: We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber. I’m told he reads all night.
MAESTER LUWIN: I’m told he drinks all night.
CATELYN: How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
LUWIN: We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we’ll find out.
CATELYN: In any case, candles.
[Scene shifts to Robb, Theon, and Jon getting barbered.]
JON: Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
THEON: It’s for the queen, I bet. I hear she’s [sleek as a mink?]
ROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
THEON: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
ROBB: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
[Scene shifts to the royal procession approaching Winterfell. Bran sees them from his perch high atop a castle wall and clambers nimbly down to tell everyone. CATELYN and LUWIN walk to the courtyard, passing BRAN’s wolf pup.]
CATELYN: Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!
BRAN: I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!
CATELYN: HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU: No climbing!
BRAN: But he’s coming right now! Down our road!
CATELYN: I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME: No more climbing.
BRAN (LOOKING DOWN): I promise.
CATELYN: D’you know what?
BRAN: What?
CATELYN: You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
[BRAN runs off, followed by his wolf pup.]
[Scene shifts to grand entry of the king’s horses and men. ARYA, wearing a helm and cloak, pushes her way into a tall wagon for a better look. In rides JOFFREY, followed by the HOUND. The other Starks wait in a greeting line.]
CATELYN: Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?
[More riders with banners. ARYA scoots past her parents to get in the receiving line.]
NED: Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA’s helm]
ARYA (PUSHING BRAN): Move!
[JOFFREY rides up, SANSA smiles at him, ROBB glares at JOFFREY. The HOUND pulls up his helm. The coach carrying CERSEI lumbers in, followed by KING ROBERT. All kneel. ROBERT heaves himself off his horse. NED looks shocked at the sight of his old friend, now fat and red-faced. ROBERT signals for all to rise and looks at NED.]
NED: Your Grace.
ROBERT: You’ve got fat.
[NED gives ROBERT a “What about you?” look. They start laughing.]
ROBERT: Cat!
CATELYN: Your Grace.
ROBERT: Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
NED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
[CERSEI and her other children descend from the coach.]
ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
SANSA: Will you shut up?
ROBERT: Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you’re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?
ARYA: Arya.
ROBERT (to BRAN) Ooh. Show us your muscles. You’ll be a soldier.
[JAIME removes his helm.]
ARYA: That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.
SANSA: Would you please shut up.
[CERSEI approaches.]
NED: My queen.
CATELYN: My queen.
ROBERT: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
CERSEI: We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
ROBERT: Ned.
ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
[CERSEI, humiliated in front of all, walks back to JAIME.]
CERSEI: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
[Scene changes to the crypt.]
NED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.
ROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
NED: We both did.
ROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.
NED: Aye.
ROBERT: Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.
[NED kneels.]
NED: I’m not worthy of the honor.
ROBERT: I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses.
[Scene changes to JAIME in the Winterfell settlement. We see Tyrion inside a whorehouse, swilling liquor and laughing as a woman pops into view after servicing him.]
TYRION: Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
ROS: Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
TYRION: I did hear something about that.
ROS: And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
TYRION: And the other brother?
ROS: The queen has two brothers?
TYRION: There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.
ROS: I hear they call him the Imp.
TYRION: I hear he hates that nickname.
ROS: Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
TYRION: Clever girl.
ROS: We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
TYRION: Have you?
TYRION: The gods gave me one blessing.
[She climbs on TYRION. JAIME walks in without knocking.]
JAIME: Don’t get up.
ROS: M’lord.
TYRION: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
JAIME: You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.
TYRION: She has odd cravings, our sister.
JAIME: A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people.
TYRION: I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.
JAIME: I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown.
[JAIME leaves.]
TYRION: Close the door!
[Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna’s tomb. Robert places a feather in the hand of her statue.]
ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
ROBERT: She belonged with me.
[He touches Lyanna’s face.]
ROBERT: In my dreams, I kill him every night.
NED: It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.
ROBERT: Not all of them.
[Scene shifts to Daenerys on a balcony in Pentos, across the Narrow Sea.]
VISERYS (OFF CAMERA): Daenerys!
[He enters a large chamber.]
VISERYS: Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?
DAENERYS: We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.
VISERYS: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?
DAENERYS: No.
[VISERYS nods and starts to leave the chamber. He turns.]
VISERYS: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
[Daenerys turns and steps into a steaming hot bath with a despairing look on her face.]
MAID: It’s too hot, my lady.
[But DAENERYS keeps stepping deeper. The scene shifts to ILLYRIOS, DAENERYS, AND VISERYS outside the mansion, awaiting Khal Drogo.]
VISERYS: Where is he?
ILLYRIO: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
[A host of Dothraki come riding up. Khal Drogo wheels his stallion into the front.]
ILLYRIO: (Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.
VISERYS (to DAENERYS) Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.
ILLYRIO: Come forward, my dear.
[KHAL DROGO watches as DAENERYS walks toward him. She does not hesitate and looks straight at him, although there is fear on her face. KHAL DROGO gazes at her and then leads his horsemen on a charge away.]
VISERYS: Where’s he going?
ILLYRIO: The ceremony is over.
VISERYS: But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?
ILLYRIO: Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn’t like her, we’d know.
[The scene shifts to ILLYRIO, VISERYS, AND DAENERYS ON A GARDEN BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE SEA.]
ILLYRIO: It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
VISERYS: When will they be married?
ILLYRIO: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
VISERYS: Is it true they lie with their horses?
ILLYRIO: I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.
VISERYS: Do you take me for a fool?
ILLYRIO: I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.
VISERYS: I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
DAENERYS (pleadingly) I don’t want to be his queen. I want to go home.
VISERYS: So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
DAENERYS: I don’t know.
VISERYS: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took.
[He gives DAENERYS a brotherly kiss on the forehead and walks away. The scene shifts to a bedroom in Winterfell, where CATELYN is fixing SANSA’S hair.]
SANSA: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
CATELYN: Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
SANSA: He’s so handsome.
[CATELYN rolls her eyes.]
SANSA: When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
CATELYN: Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.
SANSA: Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
CATELYN: He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave me. And so would you.
SANSA: You left your home to come here. And I’d be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
CATELYN: Sansa…
SANSA: Please, please. It’s the only thing I ever wanted.
[Scene shifts to the Winterfell banquet. Laughter, music, KING ROBERT getting bawdy with a wench. CATELYN and CERSEI watch, CATELYN embarrassed for CERSEI, who looks disgusted. Out in the courtyard, JON takes out his frustration on a fencing dummy. His uncle BENJEN rides up.]
BENJEN: Is he dead yet?
JON: Uncle Benjen!
[They hug.]
BENJEN: You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren’t you at the feast?
JON: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
BENJEN: Well, you’re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
JON: So take me with you when you go back.
BENJEN: Jon…
JON: Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.
BENJEN: The Wall isn’t going anywhere.
JON: I’m ready to swear your oath.
BENJEN: You don’t understand what you’d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
JON: I don’t care about that.
BENJEN: You might, if you knew what it meant. … I’d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We’ll talk later.
[BENJEN goes to the banquet.]
TYRION: Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.
JON: What’re you doing back there?
TYRION (DRINKING): Preparing for a night with your family. I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.
JON: You’re Tyrion Lannister. The queen’s brother?
TYRION: My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?
[JON looks angry and turns away.]
TYRION: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.
JON: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
TYRION: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.
JON: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
TYRION: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.
[TYRION departs. JON picks up his sword and attacks the dummy with new ferocity.]
[The scene shifts back to the banquet, in full raucous swing. NED is off to himself; BENJEN comes up to him.]
BENJEN: You at a feast -- It’s like a bear in a trap.
NED: The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
BENJEN: Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.
NED: He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
BENJEN: The two he was with are still missing.
NED: A wildling ambush.
BENJEN: Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
NED: Winter is coming.
[ROBB approaches.]
ROBB: Uncle Benjen.
BENJEN: Robb boy. How are ye?
ROBB: I’m good.
[KING ROBERT gets even more bawdy with a wench.]
CATELYN (in desperation) Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
CERSEI: Yes. Lovely country.
[They observe SANSA.]
CATELYN: I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
[SANSA approaches and smiles shyly at CERSEI.]
CERSEI: Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?
SANSA: Thirteen, Your Grace.
CERSEI: You’re tall. Still growing?
SANSA: I think so, Your Grace.
CERSEI: And have you bled yet?
SANSA (DISCOMFITED): No, Your Grace.
CERSEI: And your dress. Did you make it?
[SANSA nods yes.]
CERSEI: Such talent. You must make something for me.
[SANSA departs.]
CERSEI (TO CATELYN]: I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
CATELYN: I hear the same.
CERSEI: Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.
[SANSA and JOFFREY catch each other’s eye. JOFFREY smiles at her and she turns to her friend.]
[JAIME and NED meet up. JAIME blocks their path.]
NED: Your pardon.
JAIME: I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true.
NED: Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.
JAIME: I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
NED: I don’t fight in tournaments.
JAIME: No? Getting a little old for it?
NED: I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do.
JAIME: Well said.
[ARYA flips food onto SANSA’s face.]
SANSA: Arya!
[CATELYN signals a laughing ROBB to deal with the girls. He hoists up ARYA.]
ROBB: Time for bed.
[The scene shifts to after the banquet. NED and CATELYN are in their bed.]
NED: I’m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital.
CATELYN: I won’t let him take you.
NED: The king takes what he wants. That’s why he’s king.
CATELYN: I’ll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.’
NED: How did he get so fat?
CATELYN: He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink.
[There’s a knock at the door.]
A VOICE: It’s Maester Luwin, my lord.
NED: Send him in.
LUWIN: Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.
[He hands CATELYN a sealed note.]
NED: Stay.
CATELYN: This was sent from the Eyrie. What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding.
[CATELYN reads the note, looks up in alarm, and then burns it.]
NED: What news?
CATELYN: She’s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
NED: She’s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn’t know what she’s saying.
CATELYN: Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?
LUWIN: If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
CATELYN: They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
LUWIN: The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help. He’s the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.
CATELYN: He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.
LUWIN: A different time. Different king.
[The scene shifts to the wild wedding celebration of KHAL DROGO and DAENERYS. Fighting and fornication. DAENERYS looks stricken at everything around her.]
VISERYS: When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
ILLYRIO: If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
VISERYS: When?
ILLYRIO: When their omens favor war.
VISERYS: I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
[The sex and violence intensify. Two men fight to the death over a woman each is trying to rape. KHAL DROGO watches avidly.]
ILLYRIO: A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
[A knight in Westerosi garb appears. KHAL DROGO greets him in Dothraki. It is JORAH MORMONT, bearing books.]
JORAH: A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
DAENERYS: Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?
JORAH: Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
[DANY is presented with a chest with three dragon eggs in it.]
ILLYRIO: Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
DAENERYS: Thank you, Magister.
[KHAL DROGO rises and strides forward. DAENERYS follows him, looking sick with fear. The Dothraki crowd behind her as she goes. The KHAL leads her to a white mare.]
DAENERYS: She’s beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
JORAH: There is no word for ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
[The KHAL puts DANY on her horse and mounts his.]
VISERYS: Make him happy.
[The scene shifts to the seaside at sunset. The KHAL begins to unwrap DANY’s dress. She is sobbing. He touches the tears on her face.]
KHAL DROGO: No.
DAENERYS: Do you know the Common Tongue?
KHAL DROGO: No.
DAENERYS: Is ‘no’ the only word that you know?
KHAL DROGO: No.
[He takes off her gown and bends her down.]
[The scene shifts to Winterfell. Tyrion and the Hound are seated outside the day after the banquet.]
THE HOUND: Rough night, Imp?
TYRION: If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.
THE HOUND: I didn’t pick you for a hunter.
TYRION: The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
THE HOUND: It’s not hunting if you pay for it.
[The king and Ned come into view.]
ROBERT: Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
NED: No, but I’m still better than you.
ROBERT: I know what I’m putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You’re a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I’ve got.
NED: I hope I’ll serve you well.
ROBERT: You will. And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar!
[The king’s party rides off, NED nodding goodbye to BRAN, whose wolf pup begins sniffing at his feet.]
BRAN: Come on, you.
[BRAN begins climbing, his wolf pup crying at the bottom of the castle wall. As he nears the top, he hears a woman and man moaning. Peering in the window, he sees CERSEI and JAIME having sex. CERSEI sees BRAN.]
CERSEI: Stop. STOP.
[JAIME runs and grabs BRAN at the window.]
JAIME: Are you completely mad?
CERSEI: He saw us.
JAIME: It’s all right. It’s all right.
CERSEI: He saw us!
JAIME: I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?
BRAN: Ten
.
JAIME: Ten.
[JAIME looks at CERSEI, who gazes back imploringly.]
JAIME: The things I do for love.
[He shoves BRAN out the window.]
Daenerys on horseback looking at Drogo and his people.
JORAH MORMONT: You need to drink, child... And eat.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Isn't there anything else?
JORAH MORMONT: THE DOTHRAKI HAVE TWO THINGS IN ABUNDANCE: grass and horses. People can't live on grass... In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end… It'll get easier.
Arriving at camp, Daenerys looks exhausted from riding.
DOREAH: Khaleesi!
IRRI: Your hands.
After Daenerys is escorted away, Jorah and Viserys are alone.
JORAH MORMONT: We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
JORAH MORMONT: As you wish, your Grace.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
JORAH MORMONT: Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.
Joffrey finding Tyrion asleep in the dog’s pen of Winterfell.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.
TYRION LANNISTER: Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: What good will my sympathies do them?
TYRION LANNISTER: None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
TYRION LANNISTER: One word and I'll hit you again.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I'm telling mother!
TYRION LANNISTER: Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?
JOFFREY BARATHEON: You can't...
TYRION LANNISTER: Do you understand?
SANDOR CLEGANE: The Prince will remember that, little lord.
TYRION LANNISTER: I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...
Tyrion walks from the courtyard to the dining hall where his family is eating breakfast.
TYRION LANNISTER: Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.
JAIME LANNISTER: Little brother.
TYRION LANNISTER: Beloved siblings.
MYRCELLA BARATHEON: Is Bran going to die?
TYRION LANNISTER: Apparently not.
CERSEI BARATHEON: What do you mean?
TYRION LANNISTER: The Maester says the boy may live.
CERSEI BARATHEON: It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
TYRION LANNISTER: Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
CERSEI BARATHEON: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
TYRION LANNISTER: Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
JAIME LANNISTER: Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
TYRION LANNISTER: And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
CERSEI BARATHEON: The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
JAIME LANNISTER: Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.
TYRION LANNISTER: Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
JAIME LANNISTER: My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
TYRION LANNISTER: My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.
In Bran’s room with Catelyn at his bedside, Cersei coming to console.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Please.
CATELYN STARK: I would have dressed, your Grace.
CERSEI BARATHEON: This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
CATELYN STARK: I never knew.
CERSEI BARATHEON: It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
CATELYN STARK: I am grateful..
CERSEI BARATHEON: Perhaps this time she'll listen.
Near the Smith in a courtyard of Winterfell.
JAIME LANNISTER: A sword for the wall?
JON SNOW: I already have one.
JAIME LANNISTER: Good man. Have you swung it yet?
JON SNOW: Of course I have.
JAIME LANNISTER: At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
JON SNOW: We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
JAIME LANNISTER: Is it "we" already? Have you taken your vows then?
JON SNOW: Soon enough.
JAIME LANNISTER: Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.
Arya’s room, packing things for her trip to King’s Landing, having her direwolf assist her. Jon comes in to say goodbye before he leaves for the Night's Watch.
ARYA STARK: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. "My things weren't properly folded", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
JON SNOW: It's good you've got help.
ARYA STARK: Watch. Nymeria, gloves.
JON SNOW: Impressive.
ARYA STARK: Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!
JON SNOW: I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
ARYA STARK: A present?
JON SNOW: Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
ARYA STARK: It's so skinny.
JON SNOW: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
ARYA STARK: I can be quick.
JON SNOW: You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
ARYA STARK: I think so.
JON SNOW: FIRST LESSON: Stick them with the pointy end.
ARYA STARK: I know which end to use.
JON SNOW: I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.
ARYA STARK: Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
Jon walks into Bran’s room, where Catelyn is still at his bedside.
JON SNOW: I came to say goodbye to Bran.
CATELYN STARK: You've said it.
JON SNOW: I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.
CATELYN STARK: I want you to leave.
Eddard walks into the room, Jon kisses Brandon on the forehead and exits.
CATELYN STARK: 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
EDDARD STARK: I have no choice.
CATELYN STARK: That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.
EDDARD STARK: You can. You must.
In the courtyard, Jon prepping his horse to leave for the Wall.
ROBB STARK: You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
JON SNOW: You Starks are hard to kill.
ROBB STARK: My mother?
JON SNOW: She was very kind.
ROBB STARK: Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
JON SNOW: It was always my color.
ROBB STARK: Farewell, Snow.
JON SNOW: And you, Stark.
At the split between the Kingsroad and the road that will take Benjen and Jon to the Wall.
EDDARD STARK: There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
JON SNOW: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?
EDDARD STARK: The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.
Stopping for rest along the Kingsroad. Robert has a mini table set up full of wine and food.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
EDDARD STARK: I've half a mind to go with you.
ROBERT BARATHEON: What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
EDDARD STARK: You should have asked me 20 years ago.
ROBERT BARATHEON: There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.
EDDARD STARK: I recall a few chances.
ROBERT BARATHEON: There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
EDDARD STARK: Bessie. She was one of yours.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
EDDARD STARK: Wylla.
ROBERT BARATHEON: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
EDDARD STARK: Nor will I.
ROBERT BARATHEON: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
EDDARD STARK: The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.
EDDARD STARK: Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
ROBERT BARATHEON: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
EDDARD STARK: She's little more than a child.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
EDDARD STARK: Tell me we're not speaking of this.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
EDDARD STARK: But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
ROBERT BARATHEON: This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
EDDARD STARK: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.
ROBERT BARATHEON: There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
EDDARD STARK: He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
ROBERT BARATHEON: There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
Back across the sea, Drogo fornicates with Daenerys, she’s clearly not enjoying it.
On their way to the Wall, stopping to set up camp for the night.
BENJEN STARK: Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
TYRION LANNISTER: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
JON SNOW: Why do you read so much?
TYRION LANNISTER: Look at me and tell me what you see.
JON SNOW: Is this a trick?
TYRION LANNISTER: What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
JON SNOW: Until your brother killed that King.
TYRION LANNISTER: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?
JON SNOW: Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
TYRION LANNISTER: A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
JON SNOW: The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
TYRION LANNISTER: Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.
Bran’s bedroom, Catelyn still at his bedside, Maester Luwin walks in.
MAESTER LUWIN: It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
CATELYN STARK: Talk to Poole about it.
MAESTER LUWIN: Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...
CATELYN STARK: I don't care about appointments!
ROBB STARK: I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
MAESTER LUWIN: Very good, my Lord. My Lady.
ROBB STARK: When was the last time you left this room?
CATELYN STARK: I have to take care of him.
ROBB STARK: He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
CATELYN STARK: What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
ROBB STARK: Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...
CATELYN STARK: Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf’s howling repeatedly)
ROBB STARK: Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
ASSASSIN: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
CATELYN STARK: No!
The man is an assassin, when he draws his blade, Catelyn begins to fend him off. In the process her hands are both sliced. The man walks within inches of Bran and his direwolf comes in and mauls the assassin.
In Daenerys’ tent across the Narrow Sea.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Have you ever seen a dragon?
IRRI: Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Everywhere? Even in the east?
IRRI: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
JHIQUI: It is known.
DOREAH: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: The moon?
DOREAH: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
IRRI: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
JHIQUI: It is known.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
Irri leaves the tent.
DOREAH: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: How old were you?
DOREAH: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Nine?!
DOREAH: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
DOREAH: Yes.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Will it take three years?
DOREAH: No.
Jon, Tyrion, Benjen and company arrive at the wall and look at it from afar.
BENJEN STARK: Welcome.
Catelyn is on the ground where Bran’s body was discovered, below the tower he fell from. She looks up and sees the window. She now is looking through that same window where Bran fell. She investigates the room, noticing a cleared patch on some flooring, finding a long blonde hair.
Catelyn holds council in the Godswood with Robb, Theon Greyjoy, Rodrick and Maester Luwin.
CATELYN STARK: What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
MAESTER LUWIN: The boy was always sure-footed before.
CATELYN STARK: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
THEON GREYJOY: Saw what, my lady?
CATELYN STARK: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
RODRICK CASSEL: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.
ROBB STARK: They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
THEON GREYJOY: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
MAESTER LUWIN: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.
CATELYN STARK: I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
ROBB STARK: I'll ride to King's Landing.
CATELYN STARK: No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
ROBB STARK: Mother, you can't.
CATELYN STARK: I must.
RODRICK CASSEL: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
CATELYN STARK: Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
RODRICK CASSEL: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
ROBB STARK: What about Bran?
CATELYN STARK: I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
Back at Daenerys’ tent, Doreah is on top of her, “teaching” Daenerys how to please Khal Drogo.
DOREAH: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Finish a man?
DOREAH: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
DOREAH: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
DOREAH: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
The Lannisters, traveling Starks and all royal guards have stopped for the evening to rest on their way to King’s Landing.
SANSA STARK: Pardon me, Ser.
SANDOR CLEGANE: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.
SANSA STARK: I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?
SANDOR CLEGANE: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.
SANSA STARK: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
In a field next to a river, off from where everyone else is.
MYCAH: I'll get you!
SANSA STARK: Arya!
ARYA STARK: What are you doing here? Go away.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: Your sister? And who are you, boy?
MYCAH: Mycah, my Lord.
SANSA STARK: He the butcher's boy.
ARYA STARK: He's my friend.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
MYCAH: She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
MYCAH: It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
ARYA STARK: Stop it!
SANSA STARK: Arya, stay out of this.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
SANSA STARK: No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I'll gut you, you little cunt!
SANSA STARK: Arya!
Arya then steps in and fights with Joffrey, disarming him and putting him on his back. Her direwolf sees this as a thread and runs in to defend.
ARYA STARK: Nymeria!
JOFFREY BARATHEON: Please don't.
SANSA STARK: Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: Then go! Don't touch me.
A hunt has begun for the direwolf that attacked Joffrey.
SOLDIER 1: The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
Arya hidden from everyone telling her direwolf to leave.
ARYA STARK: You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
SOLDIER 2: It's a direwolf.
SOLDIER 1: I'll check down here.
SOLDIER 2: I think I heard a noise.
ARYA STARK: Go!
Jory comes to tell Ned that his daughter has been found.
JORY CASSEL: My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
EDDARD STARK: Where is she?
JORY CASSEL: She's been taken directly before the King.
EDDARD STARK: Who took her?
JORY CASSEL: The Lannisters found her.
EDDARD STARK: Right, get back.
JORY CASSEL: The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
EDDARD STARK: Back! Back to the inn. All back!
Now back at the Inn where everyone is staying.
ARYA STARK: I'm sorry.
EDDARD STARK: Are you hurt?
ARYA STARK: No.
EDDARD STARK: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
CERSEI BARATHEON: How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
ROBERT BARATHEON: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
ARYA STARK: That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
ARYA STARK: That's not what happened!
JOFFREY BARATHEON: Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
ARYA STARK: Liar!
JOFFREY BARATHEON: Shut up!
ROBERT BARATHEON: Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?
EDDARD STARK: In bed asleep.
CERSEI BARATHEON: She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.
SANSA STARK: I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
ARYA STARK: Liar! Liar liar liar!
SANSA STARK: Arya!
EDDARD STARK: Stop it! That's enough of that.
ARYA STARK: Liar liar liar!
EDDARD STARK: Stop! Arya!
CERSEI BARATHEON: She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
ROBERT BARATHEON: What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
ROBERT BARATHEON: You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
EDDARD STARK: Gladly, your Grace.
CERSEI BARATHEON: And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
ROBERT BARATHEON: I'd forgot the damned wolf.
SOLDIER: We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
ROBERT BARATHEON: So be it.
CERSEI BARATHEON: We have another wolf.
ROBERT BARATHEON: As you will.
EDDARD STARK: You can't mean it.
ROBERT BARATHEON: A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
SANSA STARK: He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!
ARYA STARK: Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
SANSA STARK: Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
EDDARD STARK: s this your command... your Grace?
CERSEI BARATHEON: Where is the beast?
SOLDIER: Chained up outside, your Grace.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
EDDARD STARK: No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Is this some trick?
EDDARD STARK: The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
Once outside, before Eddard lays to rest the direwolf.
EDDARD STARK: The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
SANDOR CLEGANE: He ran... Not very fast.
Eddard kills the direwolf on the King’s orders.
The King, Eddard and the rest of the posse have arrived at King’s Landing.
KING’S LANDING GUARD: Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.
EDDARD STARK: Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.
JORY CASSEL: Yes, my Lord.
KING’S LANDING GUARD: If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
Ned Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves, the guard realizes Ned’s disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber. First they walk through the Great Hall, where the throne sits. Jaime Lannister is lingering in front of the throne.
JAIME LANNISTER: Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.
EDDARD STARK: Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
JAIME LANNISTER: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.
EDDARD STARK: Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
JAIME LANNISTER: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
EDDARD STARK: You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
JAIME LANNISTER: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.
EDDARD STARK: But you just stood there and watched.
JAIME LANNISTER: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.
EDDARD STARK: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
JAIME LANNISTER: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
EDDARD STARK: You served him well, when serving was safe.
Ned enters the small council’s chamber where the others are already awaiting him.
VARYS: Lord Stark.
EDDARD STARK: Lord Varys.
VARYS: I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
EDDARD STARK: A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
RENLY BARATHEON: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...
PETYR BAELISH: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
EDDARD STARK: She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
PETYR BAELISH: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
EDDARD STARK: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
PETYR BAELISH: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
EDDARD STARK: Grand Maester.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: How many years has it been? You were a young man.
EDDARD STARK: And you served another King.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?
EDDARD STARK: Without the King?
RENLY BARATHEON: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
VARYS: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
PETYR BAELISH: We are the lords of small matters here.
RENLY BARATHEON: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
PETYR BAELISH: Mmm, how much?
EDDARD STARK: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Can the treasury bear such expense?
PETYR BAELISH: I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?
EDDARD STARK: Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
PETYR BAELISH: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
EDDARD STARK: How could you let this happen?
PETYR BAELISH: The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
EDDARD STARK: I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
RENLY BARATHEON: "Counting coppers," he calls it.
EDDARD STARK: I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
PETYR BAELISH: As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.
EDDARD STARK: There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.
VARYS: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.
Cersei tending to Joffrey’s “wound”.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Please, it's nearly healed.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: It's ugly.
CERSEI BARATHEON: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
CERSEI BARATHEON: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: Do I have to marry her?
CERSEI BARATHEON: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I don't want to.
CERSEI BARATHEON: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
CERSEI BARATHEON: How would you handle them?
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.
CERSEI BARATHEON: A royal army?
JOFFREY BARATHEON: Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
CERSEI BARATHEON: And if the northerners rebel?
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.
CERSEI BARATHEON: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
JOFFREY BARATHEON: For me. I'm their King.
CERSEI BARATHEON: But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: I'm not asking.
CERSEI BARATHEON: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.
JOFFREY BARATHEON: So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
CERSEI BARATHEON: Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
Arya, Sansa and their Septa are all around a table eating. Arya is stabbing a knife into the table between her fingers.
SEPTA MORDANE: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.
ARYA STARK: I'm practicing.
SANSA STARK: Practicing for what?
ARYA STARK: The Prince.
SEPTA MORDANE: Arya, stop!
ARYA STARK: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
SANSA STARK: The Hound killed your friend.
ARYA STARK: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
SANSA STARK: You're an idiot.
ARYA STARK: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
SEPTA MORDANE: Enough!
Septa Mordane begins escorting Arya away from the table as Ned walks in.
EDDARD STARK: What's happening here?
SEPTA MORDANE: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
EDDARD STARK: Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…
Ned places a wrapped package in front of Sansa on the table.
EDDARD STARK: The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
SANSA STARK: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
SEPTA MORDANE: You've barely eaten a thing.
EDDARD STARK: It's all right. Go on.
Sansa gets up from the table, leaving only Ned and Septa Mordane.
EDDARD STARK: War was easier than daughters.
Arya is unsheathing Needle privately in her room as Ned knocks on the door.
ARYA STARK: Go away!
EDDARD STARK: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?
ARYA STARK: Mine.
EDDARD STARK: Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
ARYA STARK: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
EDDARD STARK: Come here. Now what do you want with this?
ARYA STARK: It's called Needle.
EDDARD STARK: A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
ARYA STARK: Stick 'em with the pointy end.
EDDARD STARK: [laughs] That's the essence of it.
ARYA STARK: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
EDDARD STARK: No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.
ARYA STARK: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
EDDARD STARK: Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
ARYA STARK: So was I! He is a liar.
EDDARD STARK: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.
ARYA STARK: But how you can let her marry someone like that?
EDDARD STARK: Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
ARYA STARK: Winter is coming.
EDDARD STARK: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.
ARYA STARK: I don't hate her. Not really.
EDDARD STARK: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.
ARYA STARK: I can keep it?
EDDARD STARK: Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.
Bran’s bedside in Winterfell. A crow lands on his windowsill.
OLD NAN: Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
BRAN STARK: I hate your stories.
OLD NAN: I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
BRAN STARK: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
OLD NAN: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…
Robb walks into the room, interrupting Old Nan’s story.
ROBB STARK: What are you telling him now?
OLD NAN: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
ROBB STARK: Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.
BRAN STARK: Maybe we do.
ROBB STARK: How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.
BRAN STARK: I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.
ROBB STARK: Don't ever say that.
BRAN STARK: I'd rather be dead.
Catelyn and Rodrick arrive at King’s Landing, entering through a back entrance.
RODRICK CASSEL: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.
CATELYN STARK: It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
RODRICK CASSEL: My Lady.
Two guards pull up to her on horseback and hand her a scroll, informing her that she is to follow them.
GUARD: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?
CATELYN STARK: I would. We've done nothing wrong.
GUARD: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
CATELYN STARK: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...
GUARD: Follow me, Lady Stark.
At Baelish’s brothel.
PETYR BAELISH: Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)
CATELYN STARK: You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
Two naked whores interrupt, Baelish snaps at them to leave.
PETYR BAELISH: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
CATELYN STARK: How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
PETYR BAELISH: No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
CATELYN STARK: How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
PETYR BAELISH: A dear friend told me.
VARYS: Lady Stark.
CATELYN STARK: Lord Varys.
VARYS: To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
CATELYN STARK: How did you know I was coming?
VARYS: Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.
CATELYN STARK: Do you know whose dagger this is?
VARYS: I must admit I do not.
PETYR BAELISH: Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.
CATELYN STARK: Yours?
PETYR BAELISH: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
CATELYN STARK: To whom?
PETYR BAELISH: Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
At Castle Black, in a courtyard. Grenn and Jon are swordfighting, Jon getting the best of him and breaking his nose.
ALLISER THORNE: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
Pyp steps forward and with one move Jon has him on his back.
ALLISER THORNE: Next!
Jon quickly dispatches of another newcomer, we see Lord Commander Jeor and Tyrion looking on from a balcony.
ALLISER THORNE: Next!
Another man starts againt Jon Snow, as another joins, Jon defeats the two of them almost instantly.
ALLISER THORNE: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
Tyrion and Lord Commander talking, overlooking the courtyard.
TYRION LANNISTER: A charming man.
JEOR MORMONT: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
TYRION LANNISTER: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?
JEOR MORMONT: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
TYRION LANNISTER: Good news or bad?
JEOR MORMONT: Both.
Back in the throne room, just outside of the small council chambers.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
PETYR BAELISH: Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
EDDARD STARK: My wife is in Winterfell.
PETYR BAELISH: Is she?
Baelish leads Ned to the entrance of his brothel. Ned is not so keen on the idea and begins choking Baelish.
PETYR BAELISH: I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
EDDARD STARK: You're a funny man. A very funny man.
CATELYN STARK: Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
PETYR BAELISH: The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.
Jon is in the armory of Castle Black, putting away equipment when a gang of the guys jump him.
GRENN: You broke my nose, bastard!
JON SNOW: It's an improvement.
GRENN: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.
PYP: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
GRENN: What're you looking at, halfman?
TYRION LANNISTER: I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
RAST: What do you care about our faces?
TYRION LANNISTER: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.
GRENN: We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
JON SNOW: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
TYRION LANNISTER: GRENN'S FATHER LEFT HIM TOO... OUTSIDE A FARMHOUSE WHEN HE WAS THREE. PYP WAS CAUGHT STEALING A WHEEL OF CHEESE. HIS LITTLE SISTER HADN'T EATEN IN THREE DAYS. HE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.
JON SNOW: They hate me because I'm better than they are.
TYRION LANNISTER: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
At Baelish’s brothel.
PETYR BAELISH: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
CATELYN STARK: We have proof. We have the blade.
PETYR BAELISH: Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
CATELYN STARK: Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
PETYR BAELISH: I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
CATELYN STARK: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
PETYR BAELISH: Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
In the Queen’s chambers.
CERSEI BARATHEON: How could you be so stupid?
JAIME LANNISTER: Calm down.
CERSEI BARATHEON: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
JAIME LANNISTER: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
CERSEI BARATHEON: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
JAIME LANNISTER: Then what are you raving about?
CERSEI BARATHEON: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
JAIME LANNISTER: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
CERSEI BARATHEON: And my husband?
JAIME LANNISTER: I'LL GO TO WAR WITH HIM IF I HAVE TO. THEY CAN WRITE A BALLAD ABOUT US : "The War for Cersei's Cunt."
Cersei hits Jaime, he spins her around and hugs her from behind, whispering into her ear.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Let me go.
JAIME LANNISTER: Never.
CERSEI BARATHEON: Let me go.
JAIME LANNISTER: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
In a back alley before Catelyn leaves King’s Landing.
CATELYN STARK: I wish I could see the girls.
EDDARD STARK: It's too dangerous.
CATELYN STARK: Just for a moment.
EDDARD STARK: Until we know who our enemies are...
CATELYN STARK: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.
EDDARD STARK: Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
CERSEI BARATHEON: And if you find the proof?
EDDARD STARK: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
CATELYN STARK: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
EDDARD STARK: He still loves you.
CATELYN STARK: Does he?
EDDARD STARK: Off with you.
In the King’s chambers, he’s drinking and eating at a table.
ROBERT BARATHEON: It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
BARRISTAN SELMY: Of course, your Grace.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Who was it?
BARRISTAN SELMY: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
ROBERT BARATHEON: How'd you do it?
BARRISTAN SELMY: Lance through the heart.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait!"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
LANCEL LANNISTER: It's empty, your Grace.
ROBERT BARATHEON: What do you mean it's empty?
LANCEL LANNISTER: There's no more wine.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
JAIME LANNISTER: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
BARRISTAN SELMY: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.
JAIME LANNISTER: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
BARRISTAN SELMY: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
ROBERT BARATHEON: Your outlaw... Any last words?
JAIME LANNISTER: I cut his head off, so no.
ROBERT BARATHEON: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
JAIME LANNISTER: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... "Burn them all." If that's all, your Grace...
Riding horseback and walking through fields.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
JORAH MORMONT: The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: From whom?
JORAH MORMONT: IF YOU RULE A CITY AND YOU SEE THE HORDE APPROACHING, YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.
Daenerys sees one of the Dothraki men strike a slave with a whip for not moving fast enough.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Tell them all to stop.
JORAH MORMONT: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Until I command them otherwise.
JORAH MORMONT: You're learning to talk like a Queen.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
Daenerys dismounts her horse and walks through the field off of the path. She hears noises coming towards her and grass snapping. Her brother Viserys storms into the clearing on horseback wielding a sword.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
Viserys has his sword to Daenerys’ throat. Rakharo whips Viserys, wrapping it around his neck and yanking him to his back.
IRRI: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: No!
IRRI: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
JORAH MORMONT: Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
RAKHARO: You walk. [to Viserys]
Jon and Benjen looking out over the wall. Benjen saying goodbye.
BENJEN STARK: I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
JON SNOW: You're leaving?
BENJEN STARK: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
JON SNOW: What kind of reports?
BENJEN STARK: The kind I don't want to believe.
JON SNOW: 'm ready. I won't let you down.
BENJEN STARK: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.
JON SNOW: But I'm better than every...
BENJEN STARK: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.
Yoren and Tyrion getting drunk on wine in a the mess hall of Castle Black.
YOREN: A bear's balls.
TYRION LANNISTER: You're joking?
YOREN: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
TYRION LANNISTER: And how do a bear's balls taste?
YOREN: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
TYRION LANNISTER: Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
YOREN: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
TYRION LANNISTER: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
Benjen enters.
BENJEN STARK: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
TYRION LANNISTER: You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
BENJEN STARK: I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
TYRION LANNISTER: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
BENJEN STARK: Call me what you like.
TYRION LANNISTER: I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
BENJEN STARK: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts.
TYRION LANNISTER: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
BENJEN STARK: You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.
YOREN: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.
BENJEN STARK: Enjoy the capital, brother.
YOREN: I always do.
TYRION LANNISTER: I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?
YOREN: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
TYRION LANNISTER: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
YOREN: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
TYRION LANNISTER: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
YOREN: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.
TYRION LANNISTER: Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
Irri is braiding Daenerys hair and teaching her Dothraki. She feels Daenerys’ breast.
IRRI: Yes, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: What are you doing?
IRRI: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion.
Jorah and Rakharo around a fire in a tent.
JORAH MORMONT: For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.
RAKHARO: Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.
JORAH MORMONT: Armor.
RAKHARO: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
JORAH MORMONT: Slow.
RAKHARO: Slow.
JORAH MORMONT: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.
RAKHARO: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
JORAH MORMONT: I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
RAKHARO: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
JORAH MORMONT: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
IRRI: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
RAKHARO: There are no rabbits.
IRRI: Find some ducks, she likes ducks.
RAKHARO: Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
IRRI: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
JORAH MORMONT: I don't think she wants to eat dog.
IRRI: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
RAKHARO: A blessing from the Great Stallion.
IRRI: She does not want to eat horse.
JORAH MORMONT: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
RHAKARO: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
JORAH MORMONT: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
Back again in the courtyard of Castle Black. Jon is battling his brothers in black as Tyrion overlooks from the balcony. Jon continuing to defeat them, he begins teaching them.
JON SNOW: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
Tyrion reenters the hall to speak and drink with Aemon and Lord Commander.
MAESTER AEMON: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
TYRION LANNISTER: Eight... no, nine.
MAESTER AEMON: All of them brief?
TYRION LANNISTER: They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
MAESTER AEMON: THIS SUMMER HAS LASTED NINE. BUT REPORTS FROM THE CITADEL TELL US THE DAYS GROW SHORTER. THE STARKS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT EVENTUALLY : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.
JEOR MORMONT: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.
TYRION LANNISTER: Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
JEOR MORMONT: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
MAESTER AEMON: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
JEOR MORMONT: Your sister sits by the side the King. Tell her we need help.
MAESTER AEMON: When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.
The Khal and Daenerys are intertwined in their tent via candlelight. Daenerys surprises Drogo and speaks Dothraki to him.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: It’s a boy.
KHAL DROGO: How do you know?
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I know.
Tyrion is pissing off of the wall, when he’s done, Jon and him converse near a fire.
JON SNOW: I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
TYRION LANNISTER: It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
JON SNOW: Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
TYRION LANNISTER: I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
JON SNOW: If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.
TYRION LANNISTER: Of course.
JON SNOW: He'll never walk again.
TYRION LANNISTER: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.
JON SNOW: Farewell, My Lord.
Arya arrives to her “dance lesson” in King’s Landing.
SYRIO FOREL: You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
ARYA STARK: Who are you?
SYRIO FOREL: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.
Syrio throws a wooden sword to Arya, she does not catch it, but drops it.
SYRIO FOREL: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.
ARYA STARK: It's too heavy.
SYRIO FOREL: It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
ARYA STARK: What if I drop it?
SYRIO FOREL: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.
ARYA STARK: I'm a girl.
SYRIO FOREL: Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...
ARYA STARK: A needle.
SYRIO FOREL: Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.
Arya takes several attempts as Syrio turns his back, defending her and disarming her constantly. She begins picking up on a few things, but still needs much work. Ned enters in the doorway and his smile turns to a grimace watching his daughter swordfight.
SYRIO FOREL: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.

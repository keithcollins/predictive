GEORGE: O.K., Danny, take a swing. <Tartabull swings the bat.> N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
TARTABULL: Really?
GEORGE: No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
TARTABULL (WIPING SWEAT FROM HIS BROW): Alright, alright.
GEORGE: What are all sweatin' for?
TARTABULL: It's hot in this uniform.
GEORGE: Hot? <Feels Tartabull's material.> What is this?
TARTBULL: What is what?
GEORGE: This uniform, what's it made from?
TARTBULL: I don't know, cotton?
GEORGE: No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. <Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.> Will you stop it? <Looks at the tag.> Oh. Of course. Polyester!
TARTABULL: So?
GEORGE: I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
TARTABULL: Well, this is what they give us.
GEORGE: You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
TARTABULL: You really think cotton's better?
GEORGE: Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
TARTABULL: Yeah, good idea. Catch ya later. <Leaves.>
GEORGE: Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. <George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.>
New scene - Jerry and Elaine watching the ball game in the stands.
HOT DOG VENDOR: Hot dogs here! Yankee franks!
ELAINE: Oh, you want one?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: I'll get it. <Reaches in her bag for money.>
JERRY: That's alright, I got it.
ELAINE: Jerry!
JERRY: Elaine, stop it.
ELAINE: Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
JERRY: I'm sorry.
ANNOUNCER ON P.A. SYSTEM: Your attention please...the New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut, Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota, all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City. <The three contestants make their way to their seats, right across the aisle from Jerry and Elaine.>
JERRY (TO ELAINE): Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
ELAINE: Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
JERRY: Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?
ELAINE: Yeah, she was an editor.
JERRY: Right, just like you.
ELAINE: Yeah. Can you hold my seat? <Elaine gets up.>
CROWD: Hey! Down in front! <Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.>
JERRY (OFFERS A HOT DOG TO MISS RHODE ISLAND): Hot dog?
MISS RHODE ISLAND: No, thanks. I'm watching my weight.
JERRY: Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
MISS RHODE ISLAND: Rhode Island.
JERRY: I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. <Miss Rhode Island laughs.>
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.
GEORGE: Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
JERRY: Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
GEORGE: You're incredible.
JERRY: And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
GEORGE: What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
JERRY: The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
GEORGE: Chaperone? What, are you kidding?
JERRY: No, it's part of the contest rules.
GEORGE: What does the chaperone do?
JERRY: I don't know, she just sits there.
GEORGE: Can she talk?
JERRY: I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. <Picks up the phone and dials.>
GEORGE: You're calling her?
JERRY: Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
GEORGE: Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
JERRY: Of course, they're polyester.
GEORGE: Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
JERRY: Why do they wear polyester?
GEORGE: I don't know. That's all gonna change.
JERRY: You're going to do something about it?
GEORGE: Why shouldn't I?
JERRY (DOUBTFULLY): No reason...
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.
LANDIS: Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace.
ELAINE (GUSHING): Yes! Grace!
LANDIS: Not many people have grace.
ELAINE: Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
LANDIS: You can't have "a little grace." You either have grace, or you...don't.
ELAINE: O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
LANDIS: And you can't acquire grace.
ELAINE: Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
LANDIS: Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.
ELAINE (FED UP): Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
LANDIS: Thank you for coming in.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, right.
LANDIS: We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know.
ELAINE (STANDS UP): I have no chance, do I?
LANDIS: No. <They shake hands.>
LANDIS'S INTERCOM: Justin Pitt to see you.
ELAINE: Justin Pitt?
LANDIS: He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.
ELAINE: "Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.
LANDIS: Excuse me?
ELAINE: Nothing. <Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.>
PITT: Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
LANDIS: Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. <Elaine turns around. With sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie O.>
PITT (CLEARLY AFFECTED BY ELAINE'S APPEARANCE): Charmed.
ELAINE: I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.
JERRY: Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? <Kramer enters.> Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
KRAMER: Nothin.'
JERRY: I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
KRAMER: What state?
JERRY: Rhode Island.
KRAMER: They're never in contention.
GEORGE: How do you know?
KRAMER: Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
JERRY: Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
KRAMER: Giddy-up!
JERRY (TO KAREN): I think I got someone!
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.
PITT (LOOKING AT ELAINE AND SMILING): The resemblance is uncanny. <Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.> Even the brown eyes.
ELAINE: Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
PITT: No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.
ELAINE: Grace?
PITT: Grace, yes.
ELAINE: You think I have grace?
PITT: Some grace, yes.
ELAINE: Just some?
PITT: Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
ELAINE (LAUGHING): Oh, Mr. Pitt.
PITT: Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.
GEORGE: Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
SHOWALTER: Sure, George.
GEORGE: How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
SHOWALTER: Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing...
GEORGE: Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
SHOWALTER: How so?
GEORGE: Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
SHOWALTER: Cotton, huh?
GEORGE: Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
SHOWALTER: You may have something there, George.
GEORGE: Oh - I've got something.
SHOWALTER (CONSIDERING): Hmm. Cotton uniforms.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.
JERRY: Congratulations!
ELAINE: Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
JERRY: Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
ELAINE: I attend to his personal affairs.
JERRY: Like what?
ELAINE: Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
JERRY: Really! Socks!
ELAINE: Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
JERRY: Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! <Kramer enters.>
KRAMER (SHOWS JERRY HIS OUTFIT): So, what do you think? Does this work?
JERRY: Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
KRAMER: No way!
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
JERRY: I'm not going to "defile" her!
KRAMER: That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
JERRY: But -
KRAMER (HOLDS UP HIS HAND): AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.
JERRY: But wait a minute...
KRAMER: Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! <Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.>
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.
KRAMER: If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
KAREN: As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
JERRY: That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
KRAMER (TO KAREN): What advice would you give young people?
JERRY: Alright, Kramer!
KRAMER: This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
KAREN: You really know a lot about this, don't you?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
KAREN: Well, what could she have done?
KRAMER: Tape her breasts together. <Jerry is shocked.>
KAREN: What else?
KRAMER: Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
JERRY: Hey, come on!
KAREN: No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.
KRAMER: Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
KAREN: Really.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
JERRY: I'll be right back. <Leaves the table.>
KRAMER: So, what's your talent?
KAREN: Magic.
KRAMER: Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
KAREN: Six.
KRAMER: No, five. But you were close.
Cut to Jerry on his way past the restaurant bar. He notices the ballgame on TV.
ANNOUNCER #1: And the Yankees take the field!
ANNOUNCER #2: Is it my imagination, or do the Yankees look a little different tonight? I can't put my finger on it...
ANNOUNCER #1: Well, from what I understand, they've switched to cotton uniforms.
ANNOUNCER #2: They seem blousier, softer...
ANNOUNCER #1: Well, it is a natural fibre...
<Jerry shakes his head and continues on his way.>
New scene - Jerry, Karen and Kramer heading home in the limo. Kramer is still going on about the pageant.
KRAMER: How's your evening?
KAREN: Well, I'm wearing this red dress -
KRAMER: Stop right there.
KAREN: No good?
KRAMER: Disaster.
KAREN: Why?
KRAMER: Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
KAREN: That makes sense. <The limo stops at Karen's hotel.>
JERRY: Well, here we are...
KAREN: Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
KRAMER: Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
KAREN: I am in your hands. <They shake hands.> Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. <They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.> Kenneth will take you home. <She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.>
<Scene ends with an exterior shot of the limo going down the street. We hear Kramer singing the Miss America theme song, and Jerry telling him to "shut the f*ck up.">
Commercial break.
New scene - Jerry's apartment the next day. Jerry's packing to go to Atlantic City. Kramer enters.
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
KRAMER: Oh, come on.
JERRY: And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
KRAMER: Oh, you're poo-pooing!
JERRY: Yes, I poo-poo.
KRAMER: Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
JERRY: I don't want to stop her!
KRAMER: You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! <Turns to leave.>
JERRY: Yeah, so do you. <George enters with a newspaper.>
GEORGE: Well, did you see it?
JERRY: See what?
GEORGE: THE UNIFORMS! DID YOU SEE HOW THEY PLAYED? LISTEN TO THESE COMMENTS! (READS FROM THE PAPER) "WADE BOGGS: 'WHAT A FABRIC! FINALLY WE CAN BREATHE.' LUIS PALONIA: 'COTTON IS KING.' PAUL O'NEILL: 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
JERRY: Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
GEORGE (NOTICING JERRY'S SUITCASE): Hey, where ya goin'?
JERRY: I'm working in Atlantic City.
GEORGE: Really!
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
GEORGE: Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
JERRY: You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. <Picks up the phone.> She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
New scene - Elaine at Mr. Pitt's. He's trying on the socks she's brought him.
ELAINE: So, what do you think?
PITT (PULLING UP THE SOCKS): No.
ELAINE: You don't like them?
PITT: No, I don't like them.
ELAINE: What's wrong?
PITT: They're too tight.
ELAINE: Too tight?
PITT: There's no elastic, you need to pull too much <pulls them up more>.
ELAINE (EXAMINING THE SOCKS): I think they look good!
PITT: They're cutting off the circulation.
ELAINE: Alright, well, I'll just take them back. <The phone rings.>
PITT: Hello?
JERRY: Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?
PITT (HANDS THE PHONE TO ELAINE): It's for you.
ELAINE: Sorry. Hello?
JERRY: Hey Elaine, it's me.
ELAINE: Jerry?
JERRY: We're going to Atlantic City.
ELAINE: Really? When?
JERRY: Today, right now! Are you in?
ELAINE: One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
PITT: Tomorrow?
ELAINE: Yes.
PITT: But I was hoping for my new socks today!
ELAINE: Well, it's just one more day.
PITT: I'm sorry. I must have them today.
ELAINE (TO JERRY): I can't go.
JERRY: Why not?
ELAINE: Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
PITT: Elaine!
ELAINE: I gotta go. <Hangs up.>
New scene - Kramer and Karen at the hotel in Atlantic City. Karen is rehearsing her stage-walking with Kramer. She does it once, but Kramer isn't satisfied.
KRAMER: No. Alright, watch me now. <Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.> Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
KAREN: Yes, I see. O.K.
KRAMER: Let's try a few more questions, alright? <Karen stands up.> If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
KAREN: Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
KRAMER: Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
New scene - Jerry in he and George's hotel room on the floor above Karen's. George enters.
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: How was the show?
JERRY: Good. How was the roulette?
GEORGE: I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
JERRY: Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
Cut back to Elaine at Mr. Pitt's. There are pairs of socks everywhere. Pitt has on the latest pair.
PITT: It's good, but...
ELAINE: But what??
PITT: Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.
ELAINE (PULLING UP PITT'S SOCKS): No, no! They'll stay up!
PITT: For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
ELAINE: But that's why I got you the tighter ones! <Holds them up.>
PITT: Oh, forget about those! <Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.> Why do you keep mentioning those?
ELAINE: What do you want!?
PITT: I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!
<Elaine curls up into a fetal position.>
Cut back to Atlantic City, the middle of the night. Jerry and George are trying to sleep, but a flock of birds outside is keeping them awake.
JERRY: What the hell is that?
GEORGE: I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
JERRY (GETTING OUT OF BED): Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
GEORGE: Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
JERRY: Wait a second. <Grabs the icebucket off the counter.> This'll scare 'em off. <Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.> Well, good night, Ollie.
GEORGE: Good night, Stan.
New scene - Karen's hotel room the next morning. Upset, she lets Kramer in.
KRAMER: What is it?
KAREN: My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
KRAMER: How did this happen?
KAREN: They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!
KRAMER (GOES OUT ON THE TERRACE TO LOOK, AND SLIPS IN THE WATER): Well, how did this happen?
KAREN: It must have been an accident.
KRAMER: Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
New scene - Jerry watching TV in his room. There's a knock at the door; Jerry lets Kramer in.
KRAMER: Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
JERRY: What? Why? What happened?
KRAMER: Her birds are dead.
JERRY: Birds?
KRAMER: Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! <Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.>
JERRY: What are you looking at? <Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.> Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
KRAMER (COMES BACK INSIDE WITH HIS FINGER POINTED AT JERRY): You killed them, didn't you?
JERRY: No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
KRAMER: Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
JERRY: Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! <Kramer exits.>
GEORGE (COMES OUT OF THE BATHROOM BRUSHING HIS TEETH): What was that all about?
JERRY: Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
GEORGE: Oh. <Goes back into the bathroom.>
New scene - the night of the Miss America pageant. Kramer and Karen are backstage. Regis Philbin is about to introduce Miss Rhode Island in the talent competition.
KAREN: O.K., this is it!
KRAMER: How ya feelin'?
KAREN: I'm a little nervous!
KRAMER: There's nothing to be nervous about.
KAREN: But I've never sung before in my life!
PHILBIN: And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!
<Karen walks out on stage and starts singing, badly. Cut to Jerry and George watching the pageant on TV at the hotel.>
JERRY: I heard those doves were really incredible.
GEORGE: That's a shame. <Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.>
JERRY: It's like watching an animal get tortured.
GEORGE: Hey, hey! Yankee game! <Changes the channel.>
JERRY: Oh, great! Alright. <We hear the announcers calling the game.>
ANNOUNCER #1: And the Yankees take the field!
ANNOUNCER #2: What is with the Yankees? They look like they're having trouble running, they can't move!
ANNOUNCER #1: It's their uniforms, they're too tight, they've shrunk! They're running like penguins! Forget this game!
ANNOUNCER #2: Oh my God, Mattingly just split his pants!
JERRY: That's a shame.
<Cut back to Karen on-stage at the pageant, still singing horribly. Kramer is shown in the wings, still trying to coach her.>
KRAMER: Poise. Poise!
(Open Jerry's apartment, Jerry is at the table and Elaine is on the phone)
ELAINE: (to the phone)Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
(Jerry picks up a yellow shirt and walks to Elaine)
JERRY: Elaine, see this T-shirts, six years I've had this T-shirts, it's my
best one, I call him...Golden Boy
ELAINE: I'm on the phone here.
JERRY: Golden Boy is always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry, here
touch Golden Boy!
ELAINE: No thanks. (to the phone)Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
JERRY: But see look at the collar, see it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly
dying. Each wash is brings him one step closer, that's what makes
the T-shirts such a tragic figure.
ELAINE: Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some
Woolight?
JERRY: No!!! The reason he's iron man is because he goes out there and plays
every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away
from him, you break his spirit!
(Elaine is suddenly excited)
ELAINE: (to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! this is so fantastic! I'm
so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK I'll be in soon! OK, OK, I'm
coming, yeah, yeah I'm coming, I'm coming! (Elaine jumps up and
dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
JERRY: The guy in the gulag!
ELAINE: Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it!
Lippman and I are going to the airport to pick him up Thursday in a
limousine!
JERRY: You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
ELAINE: Oh! Don't you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
JERRY: Hey ya know what I read the most unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the
other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was
"War--What Is It Good For?"!
ELAINE: Ha ha.
JERRY: No, no.. I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like
the title and insisted him change it to "War and Peace"!
ELAINE: But it's a line from that song!
JERRY: That's were they got it from!
ELAINE: Really?
JERRY: I'm not joking!
(George enters with a handful of mail)
GEORGE: You can't handle the truth!(he salutes)
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth!(he
solutes)
ELAINE: What, is this your mail? (She takes the mail and starts flipping
through)
GEORGE: Yeah, I grabbed it on my way, I don't want my mother reading it.
ELAINE: Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
JERRY: Your mother reads your mail?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: What do you mean like post-cards?
GEORGE: No, anything.
JERRY: She doesn't open?
GEORGE: She'll open!
JERRY: You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: What did she say?
GEORGE: I was curious!
JERRY: Isn't that against the law?
GEORGE: Maybe I can get her locked up.
ELAINE: (She looks closer at the mag.) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni
MAGAZINE! LISTEN TO THIS: Jerry Seinfled has appeared on "David
Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called
"Jerry"...that was not picked up. Georgie, why isn't there anything
about you in here?
JERRY: He can't handle the truth!
ELAINE: All right.. this is too fun I gotta get back to work.
(Elaine leaves and in the hall she meets up with Kramer, he is holding a set
of golf clubs)
KRAMER: Ah, maybe you could use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah,
here, ah, it's an electronic organizer, ah, here it is.
(Elaine Gasps)
KRAMER: Yeah you know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments,
everything
ELAINE: Wow!
KRAMER: It's got an alarm that beeps!
ELAINE: Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer! I've been wanting to get one of
these things! Are you sure...(Kramer drops a piece of paper and
bends over to pick it up and drops balls everywhere) Are you sure you
can't use one of these things??
KRAMER: Oh no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
ELAINE: Where'd you get this?
KRAMER: The bank, I opened a new account.
(Back inside Jerry's apartment)
GEORGE: Did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: I'm such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showing how
they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what
a fish!
JERRY: It's a mammal.
GEORGE: Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
JERRY: Yeah, got it from the bank.
(Kramer enters without his golf bag)
KRAMER: (over excited) Hey
GEORGE: Hey
KRAMER: (still over excited) Who wants to have some fun!
JERRY: I do.
GEORGE: I do.
KRAMER: (once again, over excited) Are you just sayin' you want to have fun
or do you really want to have fun?!
JERRY: I really wanna have some fun.
GEORGE: I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
KRAMER: Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got at the driving
range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way
and hit them-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now
picture this....we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take
out our drivers, we tea up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball
goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then.......
..... gulp!
GEORGE: Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
JERRY: Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you at the
coffee shop.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm gonna go get a paper.
(Kramer gets ready to make another swing)
GEORGE: Keep your head down.
(At the automatic teller machine Jerry is getting his money and there is a
woman beside him)
JERRY: Cash advance...yes (he looks over) no (he looks over again)balance
inquiry...no (he looks again) receipt....no (he looks again)
processing...processing...processing.(He opens the box and gets his
money and then looks at the woman and says)I won!
(Jerry starts to walk away)
DIANE: Jerry?
JERRY: Yeah
DIANE: Diane, Diane DeConn, from college. I've seen you on TV you're doin'
great.
JERRY: Yeah pluggin' along.
DIANE: I got the Alumni magazine. Ya know what ever happened to your friend
George? I never see him in there.
JERRY: Well he's kind of modest.
DIANE: He was always such a goof-off. I mean did he ever get anywhere?
JERRY: Sure.
DIANE: Yeah? What field?
JERRY: Marine biology.
DIANE: George is a marine biologist?!
JERRY: A pretty damn good one, too!
DIANE: I can't believe it I mean I would never had thought..
JERRY: Yeah...he specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the
cholesterol level in whales...all that blubber-- quite unhealthy.
You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they
don't have to be."
(In the coffee shop Jerry and George are sitting)
GEORGE: Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!
JERRY: Something huh?
GEORGE: Yeah! How'd she look.
JERRY: She looked great. She asked about you.
GEORGE: She did! What did she say?
JERRY: "How's George?"
GEORGE: George! She said George? She remembered my name. Diane DeConn
remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
JERRY: Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with
you.
GEORGE: OK, I'm tellin' you right now if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna
be able to be friends with you anymore. I'm serious about that. You
got that.
JERRY: I got no problem with that.
GEORGE: Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your
idea of some cute little game...we're finished!
JERRY: Expect a call.
GEORGE: Oh my god he's not kidding.
JERRY: Now I should tell you at this point she's under the impression the
you are a.....
GEORGE: A what?
JERRY: A marine biologist.
GEORGE: A marine biologist....why am I a marine biologist?
JERRY: I may have mentioned it.
GEORGE: But I'm not a marine biologist!
JERRY: I'm aware of that.
GEORGE: So?
JERRY: You don't think it's a good job.
GEORGE: I didn't think it was a job.
JERRY: Oh. It's a fascinating field!
GEORGE: What if she calls. What will I say?
(In George's parent's house...George is sitting in a chair. He is talking to
Diane on the phone)
GEORGE: Algae, obviously plankton, I don't know what else I can tell you, Oh
I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living
with the turtles.
(In the limo Elaine, Lippman, and Testikov are talkin')
LIPPMAN: We have got you in a very nice hotel, I don't know how you like to
work but I can arrange for an office if you want.
TESTIKOV: I will work in hotel...much better. I will work away from all the
penny bickering and interference.
LIPPMAN: You know Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces
inspired him.
TESTIKOV: He didn't need any inspiration....God spoke through his pen.
ELAINE: That is so true! Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has
been as highly acclaimed as it was if it was published under it's
original name "War---What Is It Good For?"
LIPPMAN: What?
ELAINE: Yes. Mr. Lippman. It was his mistress who insisted he called it
"War and Peace." "War--What Is It Good For."(sang) Absolutely
nothin'! (spoken to Testikov)that's the song that they got from
Tolstoy.
LIPPMAN: I'm sorry, it's just her sense of humor.
(Elaine's organizer starts beeping)
TESTIKOV: What is that noise!
LIPPMAN: What is that?
ELAINE: It's coming from my purse. It must be my new organizer, here.
LIPPMAN: Elaine...here!
TESTIKOV: Turn it off.
LIPPMAN: It's the top one!
ELAINE: I'm trying!
TESTIKOV: HERE!
(He throws it out the window of the limo)
(On the beach Kramer is getting ready to hit a ball. He swings and misses.
He looks for it in the air and the notes that it is still on the
ground. Then he goes nuts)
JERRY: I did it for you.
GEORGE: Yeah, but what did you have to tell her that for. You put me in a
very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable
with this whole thing.
JERRY: You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
GEORGE: Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know
what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands
livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
JERRY: Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the
squeaking and the squealing.
GEORGE: Why couldn't you have made me an architect? You know I always
wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I'm supposed to see
her tomorrow, I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. Maybe she likes
me for me.
(Kramer bangs into the room with his golf clubs)
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs) I don't want em!
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and
I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out!
JERRY: Well what happened?
KRAMER: I have no concentration!
(Kramer starts to scratch his body and rip his coat off)
JERRY: What, what, what's wrong with you?
KRAMER: Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (Looking down his shirt) Look there
is still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the
pockets!
(He empties his pocket and tons of sand falls out)
JERRY: Hey you're getting it all over the floor!
(Karma falls over as the phone rings)
JERRY: (to the phone)Hello....yeah....yes it is....really....oh. Can you
hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some
woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me
to help track down the owner.
GEORGE: How'd she find it?
JERRY: It hit her in the head!
(Woman on the phone and Jerry are sitting in the coffee shop)
CORINNE: So I am walkin' along, minding my own business when all off the
sudden this thing come flying out off no were and cunks me right on
the head.
JERRY: Ya.
CORINNE: Yeah, So they took me to the hospital and they put me in this thing
that fells like a coffin for forty-five minutes. Have you ever been
in one of those things? You could go berserk in there!
JERRY: Well you have insurance...
CORINNE: I wish!
JERRY: Unbelievable!
CORINNE: Yeah.
(Organizer beeps)
JERRY: What is with this thing.
CORINNE: I don't know, it never shuts up. So anyway, you can see why I
would be interested in finding this person.
JERRY: Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
(Organizer beeps again)
CORINNE: (shouting at the top of her lungs)Stop it! Stop it!
JERRY: Let me have a look at this thing.
CORINNE: Yeah know somebody told me they thought they saw it coming out of
a limousine.
JERRY: Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
CORINNE: Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button.
JERRY: I would like to know what my name is doin in this creep's organizer
to begin with.
CORINNE: Ya.
JERRY: Who do I even know that would have been in a limousine yesterday
anyway. OHHHH!
(In the hallway Elaine knocks on Kramer's door, he answers)
KRAMER: Oh, hey.
ELAINE: Hey, "great" organizer that you gave me.
(Kramer is still itching cause the sand)
KRAMER: Oh, you like it huh.
ELAINE: It wouldn't stop beeping in the car so Testikov through it out the
window.
KRAMER: Oh.
ELAINE: I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm
lost now, Kramer.
(He goes crazy again)
ELAINE: What, what is it?
KRAMER: The sand, it's everywhere!
ELAINE: OK I'll see you later.
(Kramer closes the door and Jerry walks up to his door)
JERRY: Oh, there you are!
ELAINE: There you are!
JERRY: So?
ELAINE: So?
JERRY: So what do you have to say for yourself?
ELAINE: So what do you have to say for yourself?
(Jerry unlocks the door and they both walk in and close the door)
JERRY: Why should I have anything for say for myself?
ELAINE: "War-- What is it go for?"!
JERRY: Ha Ha, who told you?
ELAINE: Ha ha ha. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
JERRY: You told Testikov that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What
Is IT Good For?"?
ELAINE: Ya know what happened?
JERRY: Can I take a guess?
ELAINE: Please.
JERRY: Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
(Elaine pushes Jerry)
ELAINE: What, how did you know that?
JERRY: Because I know who has it.
ELAINE: What, how did you find it?
JERRY: Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name in
it, called me up, and we met!
ELAINE: Well where is it, give it to me!
JERRY: I don't have it!
ELAINE: Why not.
JERRY: Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the
hospital bill.
ELAINE: But I didn't do Testikov did it, he should have to pay for it!
JERRY: How much is Testikov getting from Pendman for this book?
ELAINE: One million.
JERRY: Well that's a start.
(George and Diane are walking on the beach)
GEORGE: Then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils and took
on the more familiar look that we know today. But if you look
really closely you can still see a bump where the nose use to be.
DIANE: Really?
GEORGE: Yeah, but enough about fish I can talk about other things like...
architecture...
(At the hotel that Testikov is staying at)
JERRY: You know what room Testikov's in?
ELAINE: Ya, 308. I'm crazy for doing this!
JERRY: Well, you want to get your organizer back don't you?
ELAINE: Why are you so interested, you want to take her out?
JERRY: You know when Super Man saves someone no one asks if he's trying to
hit on her!
ELAINE: Well you're not Super Man.
JERRY: Well you're not Louis Lane.
ELAINE: Oh. Listen, you have the tape-recorder.
JERRY: Ya, are you sure you want to do this.
ELAINE: Ya I got to get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the
"New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not going to pay for it.
JERRY: Ah, here she comes.
(Corinne enters through the hotel door)
JERRY: Hi, Elaine, this is Corinne.
ELAINE: Hi, you got the organizer?
(The organizer starts to beep as Corinne opens her coat to show the organizer in her inside coat pocket)
JERRY: All right lets go. We'll meet you back here in ten minutes hopefully
with the money.
(At the beach George and Diane are still walking)
DIANE: Your parents must be so proud of you, George.
GEORGE: Oh, they're busting!
(there is a large crowd of men and women)
DIANE: What are those people doing over there?
(In Testikov's hotel room there is a knock and he goes to answer it. He
opens it up and it is Jerry and Elaine)
TESTIKOV: (In a loud and cranky voice) What, What is it! Oh! Come in. That
is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring
guest for my entertainment?
ELAINE: Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. He accompanied me, ya know, single
woman alone in a big city could be dangerous.
JERRY: Yes. That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble and
zip, I'm gone.
TESTIKOV: Yeah, Yeah. The sneakers. The Americans and their sneakers.
Always running from something. Well, sit stop running, two minutes
and I'll give you the latest manuscript!
(They both sit down and Jerry picks out a very large book from the coffee
table)
JERRY: Oh! Ramscy<?>, great great book if I my say so sir. I almost read the
whole thing.
(Corinne is standing in the hotel lobby smoking while the organizer is still
beeping)
CORINNE: What!
HOTEL CLERK: If you can't thing off I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
CORINNE: I'm waitin for two people!
HOTEL CLERK: Well you can wait for them outside.
CORINNE: Yeah I guess I'd better. Wouldn't want to take any attention away
from the hookers!
HOTEL CLERK: All right, All right. Out, Out.
CORINNE: What ever you say Cro..w-well!
(On the beach George and Diane are standing with the crowd)
DIANE: What's going on over here?
WOMAN AT BEACH: There is a beached whale, she's dying.
VOICE: Is anyone here a marine biologist?
(In Testikov's room)
TESTIKOV: Here is the latest draft. I see you next week. Same time, same
place. On time please.
JERRY: It was nice meeting you, real pleasure!
ELAINE: Oh, by the way Mr. Testikov do you remember the other day when we
were in the limo and my organizer started beeping and you threw it
out the window?
TESTIKOV: How could I forget?
ELAINE: Well would you believe that it hit actually somebody in the head.
JERRY: Right in the head!
ELAINE: Boing!
(The tape-recorder in Elaine's purse starts to squeak)
TESTIKOV: (Shouting)What is that noise!
ELAINE: Um ,nothing.
TESTIKOV: What is the noise!
(He grabs the purse)
ELAINE: Hey that's my purse!
(He pulls out the recorder)
TESTIKOV: A recorder!
ELAINE: No that's a radio..
TESTIKOV: You were spying on me!
ELAINE: No I wasn't.
(He throws the recorder out of the hotel window)
(Corinne is standing outside of the hotel and looks up to see the
tape-recorder falling to hit her in the head)
(Kramer is standing at his window knocking his boot on the windowsill trying
to get the sand out but he drops it)
(Newman is walking down the street whistling but he stops and looks up and he
yells as the boat hits him in the head)
(At the beach everyone is yelling at George)
CROWD: Come on! Save the whale! Hurry up it's gonna die!
DIANE: Save the whale George... for me.
(He turns and throws his hat down. He walks into the ocean)
(At the coffee shop Jerry and Kramer are awaiting the story)
GEORGE: So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I
was terrified! But I pressed on and as I made my way passed the
breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine
intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry
at that moment I was a marine biologist!
(Elaine enters and sits down)
ELAINE: George I was just reading this thing in the papers, it's amazing!
GEORGE: I know I was just telling them the story.
KRAMER: Come on George, finish the story.
GEORGE: The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man trying to
return soup at a deli!
(Jerry gives Kramer a "what the h-" glance)
GEORGE: I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great beast
appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a
foot. As if sensing my presence he gave out a big bellow. I said,
"Easy big fella!" And then as I watched him struggling I realized
something was obstructing his breathing. From where I was standing
I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
JERRY: Mammal.
GEORGE: Whatever.
KRAMER: Well, what did you do next?
GEORGE: Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!
(George pulls out of the inside pocket a golf ball)
(Jerry and George just stare at Kramer)
KRAMER: What is that a Titleist? A hole in one eh.
JERRY: Well the crowd most have gone wild!
GEORGE: Oh yes they did Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1.
Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me, and kissed me. We
both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so
beautiful. It was at that moment I decided to tell her I was not a
marine biologist!
JERRY: Wow! What'd she say?
GEORGE: She told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
JERRY: All right lets go.
ELAINE: Are you in a bad mood?
JERRY: No, I just got my laundry back.
ELAINE: Ohhh! GoldenBoy?
JERRY: He didn't make it.
ELAINE: I'm sorry.
JERRY: This is GoldenBoy's son, BabyBlue.
KRAMER: What's with you?
GEORGE: Sand. It's everywhere.
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and George are waiting for Kramer, so he can help them move George's stuff back into his parent's house)
GEORGE: I can't believe this!
JERRY: Oh, it won't be for that long.
GEORGE: How can I do this?! How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me! They're insane! You know that.
JERRY: Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
GEORGE: How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
JERRY: My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
GEORGE: My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
JERRY: My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
GEORGE: (Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
JERRY: A smirk?
GEORGE: Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
JERRY: I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
GEORGE: No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
(Kramer stumbles in)
KRAMER: Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
GEORGE: I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
KRAMER: Well, move in here.
JERRY: (Stopping the notion) What's that?
KRAMER: Why doesn't he just move in here?
GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
KRAMER: You can move in with me, if you want.
GEORGE: (Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Costanza's house]
(Jerry, George, and Kramer enter carrying George's luggage. Kramer clumsily bangs the wall with one of the suitcases)
ESTELLE: Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
KRAMER: Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
ESTELLE: Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
(They set down George's luggage)
KRAMER: Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
ESTELLE: More stuff?!
KRAMER: Yeah. (Exits)
ESTELLE: (To George) How much is there?!
GEORGE: (Annoyed) There's more.
ESTELLE: So, how are ya, Jerry?
JERRY: Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
ESTELLE: (Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
JERRY: No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-
ESTELLE: (Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna
sandwiches.
GEORGE: Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
ESTELLE: What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.
JERRY: No thanks.
(Kramer enters with some more suitcases)
ESTELLE: Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
KRAMER: Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
ESTELLE: I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
JERRY: I really don't eat it.
ESTELLE: What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
JERRY: I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
KRAMER: (Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
GEORGE: (Muttering) No, that's it.
(A horn honks from outside the house)
KRAMER: Oh, I gotta go move the car. (Leaves)
JERRY: Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
GEORGE: (Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Wha - what are you doing later?
JERRY: Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
GEORGE: Really?
JERRY: Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was
that?'
GEORGE: Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
ESTELLE: No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
GEORGE: (Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
JERRY: Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)
(George watches his mother sitting contentedly on the couch. She's staring off into space)
GEORGE: Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: A Restaurant]
(Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and Leslie are all laughing)
ELAINE: Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
JERRY: Right.
ELIANE: You remember that?
KRAMER: Yeah, well, that was a good one.
JERRY: Well..
(Kramer's girlfriend starts to mumble out some words, but Kramer's the only one who seems to hear her. Jerry and Elaine both bend forward, trying to hear what
she's saying)
ELAINE: What's that?
JERRY: Excuse me?
(She 'talks' some more. Jerry and Elaine still can't hear her. They give up - leaning back in their seats)
JERRY: Yeah.. yeah.
ELAINE: Yep. Yeah..
KRAMER: You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
ELAINE: (Interested) Oh?
KRAMER: In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah,
it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
ELAINE: Oh, a puffy shirt.
JERRY: Puffy.
KRAMER: Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
(Leslie starts 'talking', Kramer laughs. Jerry and Elaine have no clue what she's saying. They lean closer)
KRAMER: (Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
ELAINE: Uh, oh! (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
JERRY: Yeah, that's right!
ELAINE: Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless..
JERRY: (Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
ELAINE: And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
(Leslie starts talking. Of course, Jerry and Elaine can't hear her voice)
JERRY: Sure.
ELAINE: Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.
(Leslie talks some more)
JERRY: Uh-huh.
ELAINE: Yep.
JERRY: Yep..
ELAINE: Mmm
(Scene ends)
[Setting: A Restaurant]
ESTELLE: Maybe you should take a civil service test.
GEORGE: (Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
FRANK: Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
GEORGE: Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
ELAINE: Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
GEORGE: To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
FRANK: Would you believe when I was 18, I had a silver dollar collection?
ESTELLE: I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
GEORGE: I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
FRANK: (Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
ESTELLE: So what are you gonna do?!
GEORGE: I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
FRANK: I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.
GEORGE: (Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
FRANK: I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
GEORGE: (Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
ESTELLE: George, where are you going?!
GEORGE: (Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
(Scene cuts to the front of the restaurant. George accidentally runs into a woman - causing her to drop her purse. Items spill out onto the floor)
GEORGE: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
WOMAN: Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
GEORGE: (Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
WOMAN: No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
GEORGE: It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
(George hands the last of the items to her, she takes them from him, then starts to admire his hand)
WOMAN: Hmm..
GEORGE: What?
WOMAN: (Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
GEORGE: What about them?
WOMAN: They're quite exquisite!
GEORGE: They are?
WOMAN: (Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
GEORGE: Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
WOMAN: (Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(George is holding up his hands for Jerry to see)
JERRY: (Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
GEORGE: Me neither!
JERRY: What is it?
GEORGE: I don't know.
JERRY: They're hands!
GEORGE: This woman just set me up for a job!
JERRY: (Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
GEORGE: What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off
comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
JERRY: Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
GEORGE: This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a
noise) I bop into this woman..
(Enter Kramer)
KRAMER: Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
GEORGE: What are you, crazy?! What are you, crazy?!
KRAMER: What?!
GEORGE: You coulda damaged my hand!
KRAMER: (Laughing) But, it's only a toy!
JERRY: (Explaining) George has become a hand model.
KRAMER: A hand model?
JERRY: Yes.
KRAMER: (To George) Really? Let me look at them..
GEORGE: (Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out. Kramer studies them)
KRAMER: Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
GEORGE: (Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
JERRY: Oven mitts?
GEORGE: (Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
KRAMER: Yeah..
JERRY: Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
GEORGE: Thank you very much. (Walks out)
(Jerry shuts the door, then starts going through his mail)
KRAMER: You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting
all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
JERRY: Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
KRAMER: Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
JERRY: What are you talking about?
KRAMER: When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
JERRY: (Goes up to it) This?
KRAMER: Yes!
JERRY: I agreed to wear this?!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.
JERRY: But, when did I do that?
KRAMER: When we went to dinner the other night.
JERRY: What are you, crazy?!
KRAMER: What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
JERRY: I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
KRAMER: There you go.
JERRY: Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
KRAMER: Yes, yes! You said it!
JERRY: But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
KRAMER: (Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
JERRY: I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
KRAMER: Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New
Jersey is already makin' them!
JERRY: They're making these?!
KRAMER: Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, - this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
JERRY: (Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Costanza house]
(George is giving himself a manicure over a tray. He's carefully primping his fingernails)
ESTELLE: I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
FRANK: (Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
ESTELLE: (Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
FRANK: You never mentioned them to me!
GEORGE: (Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
(Estelle hands an Emory board to George. He takes it, then goes back to his manicure)
ESTELLE: I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
FRANK: No! You never said milky white!
ESTELLE: (Getting angry) I said milky white!
(A moment passes as George fights to keep his temper down around his parents)
GEORGE: (To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
(Estelle, visibly nervous, reacts, flipping the scissors around)
ESTELLE: I'm sorry.
GEORGE: You're sorry?!
ESTELLE: (Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.
GEORGE: (Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
(Another moment passes as George primps his hands)
ESTELLE: Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work) Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
FRANK: (To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
ESTELLE: (Yelling) George likes the bananas!
FRANK: (Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
(George stands up with the manicure tray. He's obviously had enough)
GEORGE: Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the
morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
ESTELLE: (Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
GEORGE: (Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: A Today Show dressing room]
(Jerry's in a back room, getting dressed while Kramer's thumbing through a magazine. There's a knock at the door)
KRAMER: Yeah, come in.
(A Today Show stagehand enters)
STAGEHAND: I just wanted to let you know he's got about five minutes.
KRAMER: Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes!
(Jerry walks out from the back room wearing the 'puffy' shirt. He has the expression of extreme resentment)
KRAMER: Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Ayye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around
Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
JERRY: (Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I can't wear this!
KRAMER: (Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate
look. Aye!
(A knock at the door, Kramer answers it - it's Elaine)
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
KRAMER: Great.
(Elaine stops in her tracks when she sees Jerry in the shirt. Then, bursts out laughing hysterically)
ELAINE: (Between laughs) What is that?!
KRAMER: It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
ELAINE: (To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?
JERRY: (Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?'? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why!
And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
ELAINE: When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
JERRY: When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
ELAINE: I didn't hear anything.
JERRY: (Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
ELAINE: (Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
KRAMER: (To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
ELAINE: (Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out
dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
JERRY: (Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
ELAINE: (Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a
chandelier!
(A knock at the door, Jerry answers)
STAGEHAND: (Looking down at a clipboard, enters) Okay, let's go. (Looks up, points at Jerry's puffy shirt) Is that what you're wearing?
(Scene ends)
[Setting: A photographer's studio]
(George is holding out his hands while a man and woman marvel at them. A photographer is fooling around with a camera towards the right wall)
MAN: I've never seen hands like these before..
WOMAN: They're so soft and milky white.
PHOTOGRAPHER: You know who's hands they remind me of? (Pauses for effect) Ray McKigney.
(The woman nods as the man looks off into space)
MAN: Ugh.. Ray.
PHOTOGRAPHER: He was it.
GEORGE: Who was he?
PHOTOGRAPHER: The most exquisite hands you've ever seen.. Oh, he had it all.
GEORGE: (Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
(Obviously a touchy subject, the woman coyly walks over to the photographer, and they both occupy themselves. The man is left to tell George the answer to his
question)
MAN: (Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his
one true love..
(Long pause)
GEORGE: You mean, uh..?
MAN: Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
GEORGE: (Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
MAN: (Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing
but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the
end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't
seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's.. until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I.. only hope you have a little more
self-control.
GEORGE: (Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
(The man nods, unsure of what to say or do)
PHOTOGRAPHER: Ok, let's get to work.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Today Show]
(Jerry's in the guest chair, and Bryant Gumbel's in the interviewer's spot. Jerry, visibly, does not want to be there)
BRYANT: (TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA) BACK NOW, 7:46. On Tuesday the 19th here in New York there will be a benefit for the Goodwill Industries - a used
clothing organization that provides service to the needy. One of the performers will be comedian Jerry Seinfeld. (Turns to face Jerry) Jerry, good morning.
JERRY: (Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant.
BRYANT: (Pointing out) And speaking of clothing , that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.
JERRY: (Looking down at the shirt) Oh, thank you.
(Backstage, Kramer's standing with his girlfriend. She's brimming with pride)
BRYANT: You're all kinda, (Waves his hands around) all kinda "puffed up". (Chuckles)
JERRY: Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
[Setting: Monk's Coffee shop]
(Jerry and Kramer are sitting opposite Elaine at a booth, eating lunch)
JERRY: (To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
ELAINE: Mm-hm.
JERRY: You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
ELAINE: (Smiling, chewing) Who, me?
JERRY: You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing
the laundry?
ELAINE: (Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
KRAMER: (Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
(Jerry and Elaine both laugh at Kramer's impression as George slowly enters. He's in a melancholy state)
KRAMER: Hey, Georgie.
JERRY AND ELAINE: Hi.
(George sits down next to Elaine - opposite Kramer)
JERRY: (To George) What's the matter?
GEORGE: (Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
JERRY: "Caught" you? Doing what?
GEORGE: You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
ELAINE: (Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
GEORGE: (Nods) Uh-huh.
KRAMER: (Laughing) She caught you?
(Elaine laughs with Kramer)
JERRY: Where?
GEORGE: (Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed
to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
JERRY: "Glamour"?
(Kramer and Elaine laugh slightly)
GEORGE: ..So, one thing lead to another..
JERRY: So, what did she do?
GEORGE: First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
KRMAER: (Reflecting on the story so far) Man..
GEORGE: I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
JERRY: What did you do?
GEORGE: I zipped up!
ELAINE: (Wide-eyed) So, she fell?
GEORGE: Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
ELAINE: No, I guess you couldn't have..
JERRY: (In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
ELAINE: (Finishing it off) ..done that.
GEORGE: So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
ELAINE: (Between chuckles) How is she?
GEORGE: (Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
ELAINE: (Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.
GEORGE: It's not funny, Elaine.
ELAINE: (Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
GEORGE: Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's
there!"
(Kramer laughs, sipping his drink)
JERRY: "Glamour"?
(Elaine laughs)
GEORGE: (Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
ELAINE: What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
GEORGE: (Definite) All together.
(The next three lines are said at the exact same time)
ELAINE: Oh, gimme a break..
JERRY: (Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
KRAMER: Oh, like you're gonna stop?
JERRY AND ELAINE: C'mon..
GEORGE: You don't think I can?
JERRY: No chance.
GEORGE: (Daring) You think you could?
JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
GEORGE: Care to make it interesting?
JERRY: Sure, how much?
GEORGE: A hundred dollars.
JERRY: (Pointing) You're on.
KRAMER: (Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
JERRY: You?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: You'll be out before we get the check.
ELAINE: (Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
GEORGE AND JERRY: (Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
ELAINE: Why?
JERRY: (Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
ELAINE: What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
JERRY: Because you're a woman!
ELAINE: So what?
JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
ELAINE: (Sarcastic) Oh.
JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
ELAINE: Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
KRAMER: (Making a point) Not everyday.
GEORGE: Alright, look, you want to be in?
ELAINE: Yeah!
GEORGE: You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
KRAMER: No, a thousand!
ELAINE: No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
GEORGE: Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
JERRY: (Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.
GEORGE: Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
JERRY: Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
KRAMER: Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
(Jerry, Elaine, and George all hook their pinkies onto his, in a 'pinkie promise', they all pull their hand away, yelling out "Yeah!")
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's sitting on the couch, eating cereal while George is on the phone with his mother)
GEORGE: (Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course
I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?!
Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
JERRY: (Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
GEORGE: (Defensively) Whatever.
(Intercom buzzes, Jerry gets up to answer it)
JERRY: How is she?
GEORGE: (Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
JERRY: (Answering to the intercom) Yeah?
ELAINE: It's me.
JERRY: Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing tonight?
JERRY: (Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
GEORGE: Oh, the virgin?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
JERRY: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
(Kramer enters, heading for Jerry's window)
KRAMER: Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
(George and Jerry quickly join him at the window)
JERRY: Where?
KRAMER: Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
GEORGE: (In awe) Wow!
JERRY: (Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
(All eyes are glued to the woman)
GEORGE: (Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
KRAMER: ..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
GEORGE: I would imagine it's all naked.
JERRY: What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
GEORGE: (Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY AND GEORGE: (Only turning back for a second) Hey.
ELAINE: Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?
JERRY: (Over his shoulder) Not me.
GEORGE: (Also, over his shoulder) Not me.
ELAINE: What're you looking at?
JERRY: There's a naked woman across the street.
ELAINE: (Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics
class. I'm gonna go tonight.
JERRY: (Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
ELAINE: (Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin'
to Mars.
JERRY: (Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.
GEORGE: Have a good time.
(Kramer casually enters, takes a few step toward the kitchen, and slaps a wad of bills onto the counter)
KRAMER: (Declaring) I'm out!
(Kramer now has the attention of everyone in the room. Jerry's mouth is open in shock. A moment passes)
ELAINE: What?!
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
GEORGE: You're out?!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?
ELAINE: Well, that was fast!
JERRY: Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door
behind him)
(Jerry, Elaine, and George all look at each other, reflecting)
ELAINE: ..And then there were three.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Hospital room]
(Estelle is on a hospital bed. George, sitting back in a chair, is visiting her)
ELAINE: I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find
my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
GEORGE: (Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.
ESTELLE: Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
GEORGE: Ma, people can hear you.
ESTELLE: (Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of
people could watch you! You could be a big star!
GEORGE: (Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!
ESTELLE: I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
GEORGE: No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
ESTELLE: Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
GEORGE: (Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
ESTELLE: I want you to go see somebody.
GEORGE: Well, I am not going.
ESTELLE: It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
(George's cousin, Shelly, enters)
SHELLY: Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?
GEORGE: (Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
(On the other side of a curtain divider, the silhouette of a shapely nurse can be seen entering)
NURSE: Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath.
(The shadow of a patient awakening can be seen)
DENISE: Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.
(The two women go about preparing the sponge bath. George is visibly affected - breathing heavily, and staring at them through the curtain)
SHELLY: (Seems not to notice what's going on beyond the divider) So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing?
GEORGE: (Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
(The patient, Denise, is trying to get her gown off)
NURSE: Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head..
DENISE: Oh.. thank you.
SHELLY: (Nodding) Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on, George is now completely mesmerized)
What is it you're doing, exactly?
(A moment passes. George seems not to have heard his cousin)
ESTELLE: George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: New York Health Club]
(Elaine, dressed for a work-out, is signing forms while talking with her friend, Joyce)
JOYCE: So, when was the last time you took a class?
ELAINE: Oh, it's been a while.
JOYCE: (Overly excited) Are you psyched?
ELAINE: (Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.
JOYCE: Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here.
ELAINE: Why is that?
JOYCE: (Pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?
(Elaine looks over, and her jaw drops to the floor. Breathless, she turns back to her friend)
ELAINE: (Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
JOYCE: He's gonna be in your class today.
ELAINE: (Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
JOYCE: I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.
ELAINE: Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's car]
(Stationary, Jerry's girlfriend, Marla, and him are making out. After some deep kissing, Marla breaks away)
MARLA: Let's slow it down a little.
JERRY: "Slow it down"?
MARLA: Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
JERRY: Ah, yeah.. I know.
MARLA: You're okay with that, right?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't
care about that.
MARLA: So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
JERRY: (Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.
MARLA: Alright, then. Good night.
JERRY: Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's bedroom]
(Jerry, in the middle of the night, is moving around - unable to get to sleep, he's restless. Scene cuts to George. He's wide awake, and staring at the ceiling. Cut to
Elaine. She's settling into bed, unable to get to sleep. The scene takes a final cut to Kramer. He's sound asleep)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's in a grouchy mood. Kramer enters)
KRAMER: (Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!
JERRY: (Out of it) Yeah, good morning.
KRAMER: Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
JERRY: She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
KRAMER: (Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
JERRY: (Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
KRAMER: So, you're still master of your domain.
JERRY: (NODDING) YES. YES I AM. (KRAMER CHUCKLES) MASTER OF MY DOMAIN. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS: I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and
I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
KRAMER: Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
JERRY: I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in
this contest - something's gotta give!
KRAMER: Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to
stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
JERRY: (Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
KRAMER: (Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our
BEDROOM WINDOWS, WE WOULD THINK: "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a
noise) throw it away?!
JERRY: Look, I'm sorry-
KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
JERRY: Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
KRAMER: (Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm
beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
(A pause as Jerry thinks it over)
JERRY: Alright.. (Takes his coat off)
KRAMER: Yes!
JERRY: ..Alright.
KRAMER: (Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
JERRY: She's not there!
KRAMER: Oh, I can wait..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Monk's Coffee shop]
(Jerry and George are sitting opposite each other in a booth)
JERRY: So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
GEORGE: Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
JERRY: Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
GEORGE: (Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..
(Jerry nods)
JERRY: (Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
GEORGE: (Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
JERRY: Lord of the manor.
(Elaine enters and sits next to Jerry)
ELAINE: John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: (Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
JERRY: Really? Did you talk to him?
ELAINE: No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at
the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
GEORGE: "Quite a workout"? What did you say?
ELAINE: (Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah."
JERRY: (Adding, fake praise) Good one.
ELAINE: So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and
TALKIN', AND HE ASKED ME MY NAME - AND I THINK I SAID ELAINE - BUT, I MEAN, WHO THE HELL KNOWS.. AND SO THEN, HE SAYS TO ME: "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?"
And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior
we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he
dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her
forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
JERRY: But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
ELAINE: (Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Estelle's hospital room]
(George quickly runs in, turning around - he checks both his watch and the wall clock. He smiles to himself)
ESTELLE: You're back.
GEORGE: Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
ESTELLE: I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
GEORGE: You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
ESTELLE: You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a
sandwich..
GEORGE: (Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
ESTELLE: (Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
GEORGE: Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
ESTELLE: I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
GEORGE: (Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
ESTELLE: But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
GEORGE: Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
ESTELLE: Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
(Nurse enters)
NURSE: (To patient) Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath.
(George eagerly takes his seat, looking up at their shadows on the divider)
ESTELLE: George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
GEORGE: (Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: New York Health Club]
(Elaine, dressed to impress, walks up to the counter. She's obviously looking around for JFK Jr.)
JOYCE: Hi!
ELAINE: Hi.
JOYCE: Did you get your hair done today?
ELAINE: No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
JOYCE: You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. (Elaine looses her composure) But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.
ELAINE: (Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
JOYCE: Let me just put this back. (Turns to put a stack of shorts away)
(Elaine violently grabs her jacket, pulling Joyce back in her direction)
ELAINE: No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
JOYCE: (Uneasy) He asked about you.
ELAINE: (Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
JOYCE: He wanted to know your situation.
ELAINE: (Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
JOYCE: I-I told him you were single.
ELAINE: That was good. That was very good.
JOYCE: He said you were just his type.
ELAINE: (Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
JOYCE: He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to
come down and say hello.
(Breathless, Elaine almost collapses)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Kramer's at the window while Jerry's on the phone with his mother, watching TV)
JERRY: Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent,
wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
KRAMER: (Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at
Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
JERRY: (Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The
wheels on the bus..
(Kramer joins in with Jerry, only, he has a different version)
KRAMER: The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
(Both Kramer and Jerry continue to sing the two different versions, trying to over ride the other)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George's room]
(George is wide awake, staring at the ceiling. Scene cuts to Jerry. Once again, he's restless and flings the covers off him. Scene cuts to Kramer - he's out like a light.
The scene takes a final cut to Elaine. Foreshadowing the next scene, she's sound asleep too)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and George. They're bickering at each other due to the lack of sex)
GEORGE: All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
JERRY: I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
ELAINE: (Through intercom) It's Elaine.
JERRY: (Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
GEORGE: Where did you get those socks?
JERRY: I don't know.
GEORGE: I think those are my socks!
JERRY: How are these your socks?!
GEORGE: I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to
have them!
GEORGE: Yeah, well, they're my socks!
JERRY: They're my socks!
(A brief moment passes as they look at each other)
GEORGE: Oh boy..
JERRY: What are we doing here..
GEORGE: ..Oh boy.
JERRY: This is ridiculous.
GEORGE: Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
JERRY: I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
GEORGE: Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
(Elaine slowly enters, shutting the door behind her)
ELAINE: Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
GEORGE: (Shocked) You caved?!
JERRY: It's over?
GEORGE: You're out?
JERRY: Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
(Elaine sets the bills down on the counter)
GEORGE: I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
JERRY: What happened?
ELAINE: It was..uh.. John-John.
JERRY AND GEORGE: Ohhhhh.. John-John.
JERRY: But you made it through the day before.
ELAINE: Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
JERRY: Why outside here?
ELAINE: Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
(George picks up the money, counting it)
JERRY: Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
GEORGE: And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
ELAINE: (Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and Marla are making out on the couch)
MARLA: Let's go in the bedroom.
JERRY: Really?
MARLA: Yes.
JERRY: You sure?
MARLA: Yes.
JERRY: You really want to?
MARLA: I do. I'm ready.
JERRY: Okay..
MARLA: I know how difficult this must have been for you.
JERRY: (Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
(They both laugh slightly)
MARLA: What do you mean?
JERRY: Well, it's kinda silly, but..
(Scene cuts to Elaine on the sidewalk waiting for JFK Jr. She checks her watch. Scene cuts back to Jerry's apartment. Marla, obviously upset, is putting her coat
on)
MARLA: Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
JERRY: No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
MARLA: I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
(She leaves, slamming the door. Jerry hangs his head, then directs his attention to his window. Eagerly walking over, he sits in his chair, staring at the woman)
(Scene cuts to Elaine. Marla walks out in front of her, trying to hail a taxi)
ELAINE: Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
MARLA: I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
Horrible! All of you!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
ELAINE: What happened?
JERRY: I told her about the contest.
ELAINE: Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
(George enters)
GEORGE: (To Elaine) Hey, what happened?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
ELAINE: (Let down) He didn't show.
GEORGE: Yeah, he did.
ELAINE: What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
GEORGE: No, no, no. He just left.
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
JERRY: Marla?
GEORGE: Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
ELAINE: (Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?
GEORGE: Yeah.
ELAINE: They drove away?
GEORGE: Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
JERRY: (Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
(All three crowd around the window)
ELAINE: (Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
GEORGE: Kramer?!
(A brief pause)
ELAINE: He's waving..
(All three wave back)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Elaine's bedroom]
(Elaine's sound asleep. Scene cuts to George, then Jerry. They too, are sleeping. Scene takes a cut to Kramer and the nudist - both asleep; then a final cut to Marla's
bedroom. She's sleeping with JFK Jr)
MARLA: Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
(Scene ends)
[setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment]
(Elaine's on the phone with Jerry)
JERRY: No eight years isn't such a long streak.
ELAINE: It isn't?
JERRY: No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
ELAINE: Get out!
JERRY: Not since June 29, 1980.
ELAINE: You remember the date?
JERRY: YES, BECAUSE MY PREVIOUS VOMIT WAS ALSO JUNE 29TH... 1972. THAT'S WHY DURING THE '80 VOMIT, I WAS YELLING TO GEORGE: "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
ELAINE: Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
JERRY: Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
ELAINE: Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
JOANNE: Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah?
JOANNE: Yeah. What's his name?
ELAINE: Joel...
JOANNE: Joel what?
ELAINE: Uh... Rifkin.
MICHAEL: Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
ELAINE: Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.
MICHAEL: Guess you better keep on his good side.
ELAINE: Very funny. That's very funny.
JOANNE: I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.
ELAINE: All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
MICHAEL: Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...
ELAINE: (she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
(scene ends)
[setting: Jerry's]
ELAINE: The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
JERRY: But you like your Joel Rifkin.
ELAINE: Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
JERRY: Ask him to change it.
ELAINE: You can't ask a person to change their name.
JERRY: Why not?
ELAINE: Would you change yours?
JERRY: If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
(Kramer enters)
ELAINE: Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
JERRY: Yeah. Eighteen strangles.
KRAMER: You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
ELAINE: You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
(Jerry doesn't have the time to open his mouth before Kramer pops in again)
KRAMER: I'll go.
ELAINE: O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
KRAMER: Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)
ELAINE: You think I should have asked George?
JERRY: Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
ELAINE: Karen?
JERRY: Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
ELAINE: Oh! The Risotto broad.
JERRY: Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
ELAINE: I tought you didn't like double dates.
JERRY: George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
ELAINE: I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
JERRY: He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.
ELAINE: And you're taking...
JERRY: Jody the masseuse.
ELAINE: Hey, did you get a massage yet?
JERRY: No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
ELAINE: Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
JERRY: Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
ELAINE: So what?
JERRY: Well it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
(scene ends)
[setting: The Chinese restaurant (the same as in 'The Chinese Restaurant')]
(Jerry, Jody, Karen and George sitting at a table. Yes! They got a table!)
GEORGE: (GEORGE IS TELLING A STORY. KAREN IS LAUGHING AND SHE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY ONE TO FIND HIM FUNNY) SO I GO INTO THIS CLOTHING STORE AND THE SALESWOMAN IS WEARING THIS (WHISTLING) LOW CUT THING. SO I SAID TO HER: "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
KAREN: That is so funny.
GEORGE: (to Jody) You're listening to this?
JODI: Yeah. I heard you.
JERRY: (to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
JODI: (to George) So what did she say?
GEORGE: Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
JODI: You just said that you said it.
GEORGE: Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.
KAREN: I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.
JERRY: (touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
GEORGE: You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
JODI: How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?
GEORGE: Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
JODI: (to Jerry) Can we go?
JERRY: Yeah. Let's go.
KAREN: So soon? (they get up)
JERRY: Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.
KAREN: Yeah.
JODI: Nice meeting you Karen.
KAREN: Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.
JODI: Oh yeah.
GEORGE: Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
JODI: Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)
(scene ends)
[setting: Jerry's place later that night]
(Jerry and Jody are sitting next to each other on the couch, watching TV)
JERRY: I strained my neck last night.
JODI: Really, how?
JERRY: I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
JODI: So what's the deal with your friend George?
JERRY: No deal. Why?
JODI: What was all that "attractive women not getting tickets" nonsense?
JERRY: He was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
JODI: I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.
JERRY: Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
JODI: Did you see the way that he was eating?
JERRY: Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
JODI: I have to tell you, I really don't like him.
JERRY: Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
JODI: It's just I hate that type.
JERRY: Yeah, he's a bad seed.
JODI: Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)
JERRY: What are you doing?
JODI: What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)
(scene ends)
[setting: The Chinese restaurant]
(George and Karen are still at the table, they're about to leave)
GEORGE: So, what do you think?
KAREN: Really enjoyed it.
GEORGE: Jody's nice.
KAREN: She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.
GEORGE: You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
KAREN: Yeah
GEORGE: I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
KAREN: You were *extremely* personable.
GEORGE: I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
KAREN: I didn't pick up anything.
GEORGE: The second time I sent the noodle back, I tought she made a face...
KAREN: I didn't see a face.
GEORGE: I tought I saw a face.
KAREN: Anyhow, what is the difference?
GEORGE: No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
KAREN: GEORGE, GEORGE, INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THIS, WE COULD BE... YOU KNOW... (SHE MAKES A MOVE WITH HER HEAD LIKE GEORGE DID IN 'THE MANGO' WHILE SAYING: "instead of the movie...")
GEORGE: He he he he
KAREN: Ah ah ah ah
GEORGE: So you think she likes me?
(Karen gives up and slams her forehead down on the table)
(scene ends)
[setting: Elaine's place]
(She's sitting on the couch, reading, and Joel is coming quietly behind her to massage her neck.)
ELAINE: (as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
JOEL: Massaging your neck.
ELAINE: Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.
JOEL: Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Dion these days. What a cool name, Dion. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Dion.
JOEL: Dion Benes?
ELAINE: Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Dion Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
JOEL: D-Dion Rifkin?
ELAINE: Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
JOEL: Elaine! What is going on?
(scene ends)
[setting: Monk's]
(Jerry and George at a booth)
GEORGE: She stayed over?
JERRY: Yeah. (disappointed)
GEORGE: The sex wasn't so good?
JERRY: No. The sex was fabulous.
GEORGE: So?
JERRY: I want the massage!
GEORGE: Did you ask her?
JERRY: I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
GEORGE: Why not?
JERRY: I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
GEORGE: So we had a good time... the four of us.
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: What did Jodi say?
JERRY: She had a good time.
GEORGE: Is that it?
JERRY: Pretty much.
GEORGE: Did she say anything about, uh...
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
JERRY: Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
GEORGE: You just hesitated.
JERRY: I was blowing on the coffee.
GEORGE: She didn't like me?
JERRY: Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
GEORGE: So she doesn't like me?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: She said that?
JERRY: Yes.
GEORGE: She told you she doesn't like me!
JERRY: Yes.
GEORGE: What were her exact--
JERRY: "I don't like him."
GEORGE: Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?
JERRY: Not everybody likes everybody!
GEORGE: I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
JERRY: You were very nice!
GEORGE: I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
JERRY: It has nothing to do with her sister.
GEORGE: I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking!
(scene ends)
[setting: hall in Jerry's building]
(George and Jerry are coming back from Monk's)
GEORGE: You vomited in 1987.
JERRY: Oh no. That was the dry heaves.
(Jodi is in front of Jerry's door)
JERRY: Jodi.
JODI: Hey, Jerry.
GEORGE: HA! HA! HEY! (MOVING HIS ARMS LIKE: it's so great to be all here)
JERRY: What are you doing here?
JODI: I was giving Kramer a massage.
JERRY: Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
JODI: I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.
GEORGE: Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
JODI: No that's O.K.
GEORGE: Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
JERRY: I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
KRAMER: Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!
JERRY: Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
KRAMER: You don't know what you're missing buddy.
(they enter Jerry's apartment)
(scene ends)
[setting: street in front of Jerry's building]
(George and Jodi)
GEORGE: No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
JODI: You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)
GEORGE: Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
(scene ends)
[setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Kramer is lying on the couch as Jerry is cutting a block of cheese on the kitchen counter)
KRAMER: (Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
JERRY: So you had a good time.
KRAMER: Oh... yeah...
JERRY: Enjoyed yourself.
KRAMER: Very... much...
JERRY: All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
KRAMER: What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
JERRY: The massages are out!
KRAMER: Wha--
JERRY: Ahh!!! They're out!
KRAMER: Why?!
JERRY: Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
KRAMER: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
JERRY: I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
KRAMER: Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
JERRY: Don't you ever talk about her like that!
KRAMER: But why?
JERRY: That's final!!!
KRAMER: Ah!!! Yahh!!!

ELAINE: Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
JOEL: Yeah. Why? Is that weird?
ELAINE: No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
JOEL: That's my mother.
ELAINE: Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.
JOEL: No, there's no resemblance.
ELAINE: Yeah, there is, right here you see--
JOEL: Elaine, I was adopted.
ELAINE: (pause) Oh. That's nice.
JOEL: The game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.

[setting: ticket counter]
KRAMER: (to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
TICKET MAN: Here it is. I need some I.D.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
TICKET MAN: Well, I can't give it to you then.
KRAMER: Are you kidding me?
TICKET MAN: I'm afraid not.
KRAMER: Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
TICKET MAN: I'm sorry. I need proof.
KRAMER: Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
TICKET MAN: Neither do I. But without I.D., I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket.
KRAMER: Where is a phone?
(scene ends)
[setting: back to Elaine and Joel watching the game]
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Would Joel Rifkin report to the stadium office. Joel Rifkin...telephone. (the crowd stops cheering and we see a football player distracted from the game while hearing the announcer saying Joel Rifkin)
JOEL: Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)
ELAINE: (to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.

(Kramer enters, moaning)
KRAMER: Oh, God.
JERRY: What's the matter with you?
KRAMER: Jerry, I need another massage!
JERRY: You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
KRAMER: Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
JERRY: Oh please.
KRAMER: And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! It's killing me Jerry!
JERRY: Well, did you get the ball?
KRAMER: Oh I got the ball.
JERRY: Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
KRAMER: Well, It's quite a thrill.
JERRY: Why don't you get somebody else?
KRAMER: Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
JERRY: Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
KRAMER: What about my massage?
JERRY: Ask Newman.

[setting: Monk's]
(George and Karen at a booth)
GEORGE: So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
KAREN: Of course.
GEORGE: No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
KAREN: What, do you think I've never had a massage before?
GEORGE: Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
KAREN: George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
GEORGE: I wanna know what I did to this woman.
KAREN: What, you got a little thing for her?
GEORGE: No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
KAREN: What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?
GEORGE: Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!

[setting: Elaine's apartment]
(Elaine and Joel sitting on the couch)
ELAINE: Of course I support your decision to change your name.
JOEL: After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.
ELAINE: Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
JOEL: Sure?
ELAINE: (she fakes a strangling) RRR...
JOEL: O.K. you got your list?
ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.
JOEL: Right.
ELAINE: O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
JOEL: O.K.
ELAINE: O.K. You start. What's your first choice?
JOEL: Stuart.
ELAINE: (right away) No. Second choice.
JOEL: Stu--Stuart's no good?
ELAINE: I've never met a normal guy named Stuart.
JOEL: O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.
ELAINE: (repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
JOEL: All right. Oh, Hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.
ELAINE: Great...
JOEL: Alex.
ELAINE: I gotta tell you, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
JOEL: Bad bad association?
ELAINE: YEAH, IN COLLEGE I SAT NEXT TO AN ALEX IN ART HISTORY. AND HE WAS ALWAYS DRINKING COFFEE AND AFTER EVERY SIP HE WOULD GO: "AHH!". I MEAN EVERY TWO SECONDS: "AHH!". AND HE WOULD TAKE LIKE 40 SIPS AND AFTER EVERYONE: "Ahh!". I had to drop the class.

[setting: Jerry's place]
(Jerry is opening the door for Jodi. She has her massage table. New age music is playing, and the lights are shaded)
JODI: Hey.
JERRY: Hi.
JODI: Hi. (kissing) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.
JERRY: Ah, no problem. That's fine.
JODI: What's with this music?
JERRY: That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
JODI: What are you doing?
JERRY: Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
JODI: Actually, I should get a new one.
JERRY: Nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
JODI: So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)
JERRY: Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
JODI: (she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.
JERRY: Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
JODI: I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)
JERRY: No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)
JODI: No, I can't!
JERRY: Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
(scene ends)
[setting: Karen's place]
(George and Karen are making out on the couch)
GEORGE: You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
KAREN: You're going now?
GEORGE: I think I can still catch her.
KAREN: All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
GEORGE: What? What are you talking about.
KAREN: I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
GEORGE: I know. I know.
KAREN: Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
GEORGE: (he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
KAREN: Well, now *I* hate you!
GEORGE: That I'm used to. (he leaves)
(scene ends)
[setting: back to Elaine's place]
JOEL: Ned?
ELAINE: What is wrong with Ned?
JOEL: Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!
ELAINE: Ellis.
JOEL: Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!
ELAINE: Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
JOEL: NEXT!
ELAINE: Ohh, what is the point?
JOEL: NO, NO. COME ON!
ELAINE: O.K. O.K. Remy.
JOEL: Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?
ELAINE: Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
JOEL: Grrrr!
(scene ends)
[setting: back to Jerry's]
JERRY: What do you mean, no?
JODI: No means no.
JERRY: Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
JODI: Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.
JERRY: Fine. Go.
(George enters. He's staring at Jodi)
GEORGE: Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
JERRY: What for?
GEORGE: We need to talk.
JERRY: *You* need to talk?
JODI: We have nothing to talk about.
GEORGE: Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
JERRY: George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
GEORGE: (he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
JERRY: I can see that.
JODI: I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.
JERRY: Don't worry. (she leaves)
GEORGE: A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
JERRY: You're a lucky guy.
GEORGE: I got to go after her.
JERRY: George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
GEORGE: JODI! (he starts running after her)
KRAMER: Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.
ELAINE: Is that tomorrow?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...<gestures to Elaine to sign the form.>
ELAINE (SIGNING): Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
KRAMER: Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
JERRY (SIGNING): It's hard enough living next door.
KRAMER: I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. <gets up> I'll be right back.
<Jerry stands up and gets a bottle of ketchup from the next table.>
ELAINE: New jeans?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: Still a 31 waist?
JERRY: Yep. Since college. <Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.> Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
ELAINE: Lena Small?
JERRY: Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
ELAINE: Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
JERRY (COPYING DOWN THE NUMBER): Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
ELAINE: You're a taking person.
JERRY: That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
ELAINE (WARNS): She's gonna ask how you got her number.
JERRY: Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
ELAINE: What's he look like?
JERRY: I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
ELAINE: You're buying a speedboat?
JERRY: See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. <Elaine laughs.> All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
ELAINE: I don't know about that.
JERRY: So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
ELAINE: Well...
JERRY: Yeah. So you really like this guy.
ELAINE: Very much.
JERRY: How's the...sexual chemistry?
ELAINE: Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. <Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.>
KRAMER: Are you still on the pill?
ELAINE: Uh, Kramer...
KRAMER: I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
ELAINE: The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.
KRAMER: But wasn't that taken off the market?
ELAINE: Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
KRAMER: I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
<Elaine laughs.>
Commercial break.
New scene - Jerry on the phone in his apartment.
JERRY: Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
New scene - George and Susan in George's car.
SUSAN: You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
GEORGE: Not as thin as you think.
SUSAN: Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
GEORGE: The tag, huh?
SUSAN: Mmm-hmm.
GEORGE: Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
SUSAN: What are you talking about?
GEORGE: He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
SUSAN: Oh, how could he be so vain?
GEORGE: Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
SUSAN (LAUGHING): Why not?
GEORGE: Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
SUSAN: Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.
GEORGE: Where did you get that from?
SUSAN: Well, we're a couple. It's understood.
GEORGE: I never heard of that.
SUSAN: Well, you've never been a couple.
GEORGE: I've coupled! I've coupled!
SUSAN: Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
GEORGE: This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
New scene - George arrives at Jerry's apartment.
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. What's the matter?
GEORGE: I had a fight with Susan.
JERRY: What about?
GEORGE: Oh...<is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders> ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
JERRY: I got a date with that girl, Lena.
GEORGE: Lena, how'd you meet her?
JERRY: I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... <Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.>
GEORGE: You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
JERRY (SLOWLY): I didn't call her till today.
GEORGE: So, uh...wanna double?
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
JERRY: I dunno. <Elaine enters.> Hey.
ELAINE: Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
JERRY: So what are you gonna do?
ELAINE: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
GEORGE: Just for these sponges?
ELAINE: Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
GEORGE: I dunno.
ELAINE: You don't know?
GEORGE: I, uh...figure it's something. <Kramer enters.>
JERRY: What are you all out of breath from?
KRAMER (PANTING): The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
JERRY: And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
KRAMER: Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
JERRY: I got a 31 waist, mister!
KRAMER: Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?
JERRY (PROUDLY): What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
New scene - a musical montage of Elaine's "hard-target search" - visiting stores and pharmacies all over town and not finding a sponge anywhere. She ends up at the Pasteur Pharmacy.
PHARMACIST: Can I help you?
ELAINE (WITH LITTLE HOPE): Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
PHARMACIST: Actually, we have a case left.
ELAINE (EXCITED): A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
PHARMACIST: Sixty.
ELAINE: Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
PHARMACIST: Three.
ELAINE: Make it ten.
PHARMACIST: Ten?
ELAINE: Twenty sponges should be plenty.
PHARMACIST: Did you say twenty?
ELAINE: Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.
PHARMACIST: Right. So, you're set with twenty-five.
ELAINE: Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
New scene - Jerry and Lena having dinner in a restaurant with George and Susan.
JERRY: Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
LENA (SMELLS JERRY'S ARM): Mmm! Very nice.
JERRY: It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
LENA: I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
GEORGE: Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
LENA (TO WAITER): Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m.
JERRY: They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
LENA: Yeah. That's all they have.
JERRY: Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"
GEORGE: I'd get tired of it.
JERRY: How could you not?
LENA: Guess who volunteered last week?
GEORGE: Mick Jagger.
LENA: No. Maya Angelou.
SUSAN: Oh, the poet!
JERRY (TO LENA): So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
LENA: I don't know.
SUSAN (TO LENA): So, did you get to talk to her?
LENA: Talk to who?
JERRY: Is it a lot of cream soups?
SUSAN: Maya Angelou, the poet.
LENA: No, I didn't get the chance.
GEORGE: Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
<Jerry gives George a surprised look. George looks back, puzzled.>
SUSAN: I'm going to the ladies room.
LENA: I'll go with you. <They leave.>
GEORGE: What are you looking at me like that for?
JERRY: Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
GEORGE: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
<George's interest is peaked.>
New scene - George and Susan in the car on the way home.
SUSAN: Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!
GEORGE: I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
SUSAN: But you told me anyway?
GEORGE: Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
SUSAN: Thank you, honey.
GEORGE: So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
SUSAN: Can we stop by a drug store first?
GEORGE: What for?
SUSAN: I'm out of birth control stuff.
GEORGE: Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? <Pulls over.>
SUSAN: Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.
GEORGE: Me run in? Why don't you run in?
SUSAN: You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?
GEORGE: Of course I do.
SUSAN: You do? What?
GEORGE: You know. You use the, uh...<mutters something unintelligible under his breath.>
SUSAN: The what?
GEORGE: You know, the uh...<mutters it again.>
SUSAN: Just get me some sponges, please.
GEORGE: Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
SUSAN: Off the market? The sponge?
GEORGE: Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
SUSAN: I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
GEORGE: O.k....<thinks> I think I know where we can get one.
New scene - Jerry approaching his apartment door. He hears the sound of a loud group of people from inside Kramer's place. He knocks on Kramer's door. Kramer answers.

KRAMER: It's a poker game...<yells to the crowd> And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
JERRY: Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
VOICE FROM POKER GAME: Hey, Kramer - are you in?

ELAINE: Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
GEORGE: Well...Susan.
ELAINE: Ah, Susan uses the sponge.
GEORGE: Susan loves the sponge.
ELAINE: Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
GEORGE: What?
ELAINE: I can't do it. No way, there's no how. <Tries to push George out the door. George resists.>
GEORGE: Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. <Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.>
GEORGE: Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
ELAINE: I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. <Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.> (To Billy) Hold that thought!
<Elaine goes into the bathroom for a sponge, but then stops and reconsiders.>
New scene - Susan talking on the phone with Monica.
SUSAN: So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.

LENA: It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
JERRY: You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
LENA: No, not at all. No problem. <Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of Kramer's apartment.>
KRAMER: Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
JERRY: You went all night?
KRAMER (SHOWS JERRY HIS WINNINGS): Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?
JERRY: Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
KRAMER: AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. <George enters.> Hey!
JERRY: So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
GEORGE: Really? How'd she do that?
JERRY: A friend of a friend of Susan's.
GEORGE: My Susan?
JERRY: Why'd you tell her?!
GEORGE: Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
JERRY: Well you know what this means, don't you?
GEORGE: What?
<IMG SRC=http://tinyurl.com/2b9c width=200 > 
JERRY: You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
GEORGE: You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
JERRY: You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
GEORGE: C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.
JERRY: If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
GEORGE: Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
JERRY: I don't know, George.
GEORGE: So, Lena was upset, huh?
JERRY: You know what? That was the amazing thing.
GEORGE: What, it didn't bother her?
JERRY: No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: She's too good.
GEORGE: Too good...
JERRY: I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
GEORGE: I see what you mean.
JERRY: I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
GEORGE: Where's the depravity?
JERRY: No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
<Elaine enters.>
JERRY (USING ELAINE AS AN EXAMPLE): On the other hand...
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE (TO ELAINE): Thanks again for last night!
ELAINE: Hey, I didn't even use one.
JERRY: I thought you said it was imminent.
ELAINE: Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
JERRY: Sponge-worthy?
ELAINE: Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
JERRY: But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
ELAINE: Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
GEORGE: You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
New scene - Kramer signing in at the AIDS walk.
KRAMER (TO ORGANIZER AT DESK): Uh, Cosmo Kramer?

ORGANIZER: You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?
KRAMER: No.
ORGANIZER: But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
KRAMER: I have to?
ORGANIZER: Yes.
KRAMER: See, that's why I don't want to.

New scene - George and Susan in a booth at the coffee shop.
GEORGE: Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
SUSAN: Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.
GEORGE: Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
SUSAN: Just once...for the make-up sex.
GEORGE: Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
SUSAN: Come on, just once?
GEORGE: No, no...I hate the condom.
SUSAN: Why?
GEORGE: I can never get the package open in time.
SUSAN: Well, you just tear it open.
GEORGE: It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.

WALKER #3: Who do you think you are?
WALKER #1: Put the ribbon on!

ELAINE: You going to do something about your sideburns?
BILLY: Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns.

JERRY: Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
LENA: Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.
JERRY: Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
LENA: Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. <Goes into the bathroom.> Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?
JERRY: Oh, o.k. <Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.>
JERRY'S BRAIN: Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! <Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.> There you are.
LENA: Thanks. So, you were saying...?
JERRY: What? Nothing.
LENA: No, you said I was a good person...
JERRY: Oh...
LENA: You seem like you want to tell me something.
JERRY: Tell you something...I do.
LENA: What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.
JERRY: Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
LENA: Yeah.
JERRY: I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. <Lena is puzzled.>
New scene - George and Susan in bed. We see George's hands struggling to open a condom wrapper.
SUSAN: Come on, George, just tear it open.
GEORGE: I'm trying, dammit.
SUSAN: Tear it.
GEORGE: I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
SUSAN: Here give it to me.
GEORGE: Would you wait a second? Just wait? <They fight over it.>
SUSAN: Give it to me. <She rips it open.> Come on. Come on!
GEORGE (TOSSES THE CONDOM ASIDE): It's too late.
New scene - Kramer surrounded by Cedric, Bob, and the other walkers.
BOB: So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
KRAMER (NERVOUSLY): No! Never.
BOB: But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
KRAMER: This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
CEDRIC: What are we gonna do with him?
BOB: I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
<Kramer tries to climb up a fire escape, but the mob grabs him and pulls him back down. Kramer screams.>
New scene - Jerry and George waiting for Kramer at the finish line.
JERRY: It completely turned her off.
GEORGE: Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
JERRY: I don't wanna be a 32.
GEORGE: I'd kill to be a 32.
JERRY: She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
GEORGE: That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
JERRY: It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
GEORGE: You never run out, do you? <Jerry smiles.> Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
JERRY: Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
<They see Kramer staggering towards them with cuts and bruises, clothes torn, one shoe off. He collapses and crawls across the finish line.>
JERRY: Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. <Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.>
GEORGE: Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?
<Kramer looks at George unbelievingly.>
<New scene - Elaine and Billy in bed the next morning.>
ELAINE (SMILING): Good morning.
BILLY: How'd you sleep?
ELAINE (STRETCHES): Great. You?
BILLY: Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?
ELAINE: Yep.
BILLY: No regrets?
ELAINE: Nope. <Billy leans in to kiss her.> What are you doing?
BILLY: What do you mean?
ELAINE: Oh...I don't think so.
BILLY: Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
ELAINE: I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. <Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.>
